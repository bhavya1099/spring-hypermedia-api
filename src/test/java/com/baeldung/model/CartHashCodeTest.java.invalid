"""
Scenario 1: Testing the hashCode() method with an empty Cart
TestName: testHashcodeEmptyCart
Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode() function for an Cart object that has no books and hasn't been purchased yet.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Cart object without adding any books and not marking it as purchased.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Cart object.
  Assert: Compare the actual hashCode result against the expected hashcode for an empty object.
Validation: 
  If the actual hashcode matches the calculated hashcode, the test passes signifying that the hashCode implementation correctly handles an empty object. This test ensures the correctness of the hashcode implementation.

Scenario 2: Testing the hashCode() method with Cart that has been marked as purchased without any books
TestName: testHashcodePurchasedCartNoBooks
Description: This test checks the hashCode() function for a Cart object that has been marked as purchased but still has no books.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Cart object without any books and mark it as purchased.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Cart object.
  Assert: Check if hashCode is equal to the expected value which is prime * 1231.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the hashcode method correctly calculates hashcode considering the purchased flag. If the returned hashcode is unexpected, it implies an issue in the hashcode method's implementation.

Scenario 3: Testing the hashCode() method with Cart that has not been marked as purchased but contains books
TestName: testHashcodeNonPurchasedCartWithBooks
Description: This test checks the hashCode() function for a cart that contains books but is not marked as purchased.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Cart object, add some books to it but do not mark it as purchased..
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Cart object.
  Assert: Compare the actual hashCode result against the calculated hashcode for an object containing books.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks whether the hashcode method correctly calculates the hashcode considering the books present. It helps to ensure the correctness of the hashCode implementation when dealing with books.

Scenario 4: Testing the hashCode() method with a Cart that contains books and is marked as  purchased
TestName: testHashcodePurchasedCartWithBooks
Description: This test checks the hashCode() implementation for a cart that contains books and is marked as purchased.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Cart object, add some books to it and mark it as a purchased cart.
  Act: Execute the hashCode method on the Cart object.
  Assert: Compare the actual hashCode result against the calculated hashcode for an object containing books and marked as purchased.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly considers both the books present and the purchased flag in its computation which it is supposed to.
