"""
  Scenario 1: Set valid author name

  Details:
    TestName: testSetValidAuthor.
    Description: This test is meant to check the setAuthor method when being provided with a valid author name. It will ensure that the method correctly assigns the "author" variable.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a non-empty String to emulate a valid author name.
    Act: Invoke setAuthor() method with the valid author name.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the "author" field of the instance equals to the provided name.
  Validation:
    This test is meant to verify that the method setAuthor() works correctly in normal conditions. It signifies the correct functionality of setAuthor() method whenever a non-empty valid string is passed.

  Scenario 2: Set empty author name

  Details:
    TestName: testSetEmptyAuthor.
    Description: This test is meant to check the setAuthor method when being provided with an empty author name. It should demonstrate whether the "author" variable handles empty strings appropriately.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an empty String to provide it to setAuthor() method.
    Act: Invoke setAuthor() method with an empty String.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if an expected corresponding exception is thrown or the "author" variable is set as an empty string.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify how the setAuthor() method handles empty strings. This is important in understanding the robustness of the method in case empty strings are passed.

  Scenario 3: Set Null as author name

  Details:
    TestName: testSetNullAuthor.
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the setAuthor method appropriately handles a null value being provided for the author name.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign null to the String to provide it to setAuthor() method.
    Act: Invoke setAuthor() method with null.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if an expected corresponding exception is thrown or the "author" variable is able to handle null values.
  Validation:
    This test aims to check how the setAuthor() method handles null values. This is crucial in understanding the behavior of the method in abnormal or edge case scenarios.
