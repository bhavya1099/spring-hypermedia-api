ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashCode_b485d3a76c
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_24d856d52f

Scenario 1: Test hashCode with null values
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullValues
  Description: This test is designed to validate the hashCode method when all the fields (author, isbn, title) are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object with null values for author, isbn, and title.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Book object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hashcode is equal to 1, as per the hashCode method implementation.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the hashCode method correctly handles null values and returns the expected result. This is important to ensure the robustness of the hashCode method.

Scenario 2: Test hashCode with non-null values
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullValues
  Description: This test is designed to validate the hashCode method when all the fields (author, isbn, title) are non-null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object with non-null values for author, isbn, and title.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Book object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hashcode is not equal to 1, as per the hashCode method implementation.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the hashCode method correctly calculates the hashcode when all the fields are non-null. This is crucial for the correct functioning of the hashCode method and to ensure that different Book objects have different hashcodes.

Scenario 3: Test hashCode consistency
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test is designed to validate the consistency of the hashCode method, i.e., it should return the same hashcode every time it is called on the same object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Book object multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that the hashcode remains the same across multiple calls.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode method is consistent, which is a crucial requirement for the hashCode contract in Java. Consistency of hashCode is important for the correct functioning of data structures like HashMap, HashSet, etc.

Scenario 4: Test hashCode with two identical objects
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test is designed to validate the hashCode method by comparing the hashcodes of two identical Book objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical Book objects.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Book objects.
  Assert: Assert that the hashcodes are equal.
Validation:
  This test verifies that two identical objects have the same hashcode, as per the hashCode contract in Java. This is crucial for the correct functioning of data structures like HashMap, HashSet, etc.
