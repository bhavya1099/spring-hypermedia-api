Based on the provided information and the hashCode() method of the Book class, here are several test scenarios:

Scenario 1: Consistent Hash Code for Same Book Object

Details:
  TestName: consistentHashCodeForSameBook
  Description: Verify that the hashCode() method returns the same value when called multiple times on the same Book object.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object with sample data.
  Act: Call hashCode() method twice on the same Book object.
  Assert: Compare the two hash code values for equality.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method is consistent for the same object, which is a fundamental contract of the hashCode() method. It's crucial for the correct functioning of hash-based collections.

Scenario 2: Different Hash Codes for Different Books

Details:
  TestName: differentHashCodesForDifferentBooks
  Description: Verify that two Book objects with different attributes produce different hash codes.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects with different title, author, and ISBN.
  Act: Calculate hash codes for both Book objects.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes and verify they are different.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method produces different values for different Book objects, which is important for proper distribution in hash-based collections.

Scenario 3: Same Hash Code for Books with Same Relevant Attributes

Details:
  TestName: sameHashCodeForBooksWithSameRelevantAttributes
  Description: Verify that two Book objects with the same title, author, and ISBN (but potentially different other attributes) produce the same hash code.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects with the same title, author, and ISBN, but different synopsis and language.
  Act: Calculate hash codes for both Book objects.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes and verify they are the same.

Validation:
  This test confirms that the hashCode() method correctly considers only the relevant attributes (title, author, ISBN) and ignores others, aligning with the equals() method implementation.

Scenario 4: Hash Code for Book with Null Attributes

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForBookWithNullAttributes
  Description: Verify that the hashCode() method handles null attributes correctly without throwing exceptions.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object with null title, author, and ISBN.
  Act: Call the hashCode() method on this Book object.
  Assert: Verify that a hash code is returned without throwing an exception.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method is null-safe and doesn't throw NullPointerException when dealing with null attributes, which is important for robustness.

Scenario 5: Hash Code Consistency with Equals Method

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistencyWithEquals
  Description: Verify that two Book objects considered equal by the equals() method have the same hash code.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects with the same title, author, and ISBN.
  Act: Calculate hash codes for both objects and check their equality using equals() method.
  Assert: Verify that both objects are equal and have the same hash code.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method is consistent with the equals() method, which is a crucial contract for hash-based collections to function correctly.

These scenarios cover the main aspects of the hashCode() method implementation, including consistency, differentiation, handling of null values, and consistency with the equals() method.
