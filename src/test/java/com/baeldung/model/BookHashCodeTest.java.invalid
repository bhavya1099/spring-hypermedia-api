ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashCode_b485d3a76c
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_24d856d52f

Scenario 1: Test hash code of two identical books.
 DETAILS:
   TestName: testHashCodeForIdenticalBooks.
   Description: This test is designed to check the hashCode implementation when two books have the exact same details (title, author, and ISBN), therefore their hash codes should be identical.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create two book instances with the same details.
   Act: Generate the hash code of both book objects by calling the hashCode method.
   Assert: Confirm that both hash codes are equal.
   Validation: 
   The assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly generates identical hash codes for two identical book instances. This test is critical because it checks the basic working of the hashCode method, ensuring it can differentiate between two objects as per their details.

Scenario 2: Test hash code of two different books.
 DETAILS:
   TestName: testHashCodeForDifferentBooks.
   Description: This test is designed to check the hashCode implementation when two books have different details, therefore their hash codes should also be different.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create two book instances with distinct details.
   Act: Generate the hash code of both book objects by calling the hashCode method.
   Assert: Confirm that both hash codes are not equal.
   Validation: 
   The assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly differentiates between two book instances with different details. It further confirms the robustness of the hashCode method.

Scenario 3: Test hash code with null values.
 DETAILS:
   TestName: testHashCodeForNullValues.
   Description: This test is aimed to check the behavior of the hashCode method when some or all book details are null.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create a book instance with null details.
   Act: Generate the hash code of the book object by calling the hashCode method.
   Assert: Confirm that the hash code is generated without any null pointer exception.
   Validation: 
   The assertion confirms that the hashCode method handles null values without causing exceptions. This test safeguards against interruptions in application flow due to unexpected null values.

Scenario 4: Test hash code for the same book instance.
 DETAILS:
   TestName: testHashCodeForSameBookInstance.
   Description: This test verifies that the hash code of the same book instance does not change over multiple invocations.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create a book instance and generate its hash code.
   Act: Generate the hash code of the same book object again by calling the hashCode method.
   Assert: Verify that the hash code remains the same in consecutive calls.
   Validation: 
   This assertion ensures that the hashCode method is consistent and generates the same hash code for a given book instance regardless of the number of times it's called.
