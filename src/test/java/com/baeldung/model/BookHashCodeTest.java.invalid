ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashCode_b485d3a76c
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_24d856d52f

Scenario 1: Test hashCode with All Fields Null
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithAllFieldsNull
  Description: This test will check the hashCode method when all the fields (author, title, isbn) are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object with all fields set to null.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created Book object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hashCode is 1 (since 31*1 will result in 1).
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly handles null fields and returns the expected result. This test ensures the robustness of the hashCode method against null values.

Scenario 2: Test hashCode with All Fields Populated 
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithAllFieldsPopulated
  Description: This test will check the hashCode method when all the fields (author, title, isbn) are populated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object with all fields set to some arbitrary non-null values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created Book object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hashCode is equal to the calculated hashCode based on the formula.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly calculates the hashCode when all fields are populated. This test ensures the correct functionality of the hashCode method.

Scenario 3: Test hashCode Consistency
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test will check the consistency of the hashCode method. It should return the same hashCode for the same object every time it is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object with all fields set to some arbitrary non-null values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created Book object multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hashCode is same for all invocations.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method is consistent and returns the same hashCode for the same object across multiple invocations. This test ensures the consistency of the hashCode method.

Scenario 4: Test hashCode with Different Objects Having Same Field Values
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentObjectsSameValues
  Description: This test will check the hashCode method when invoked on two different Book objects having the same field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects with all fields set to same non-null values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Book objects.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hashCodes are equal.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly returns equal hashCodes for two objects with the same field values. This test ensures the correctness of the hashCode method according to the contract of the hashCode method in the Object class.
