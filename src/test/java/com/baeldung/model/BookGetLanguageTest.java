Scenario 1: Validating the return of correct language value
  Details:
    TestName: testGetLanguageReturnsCorrectValue
    Description: This test aims to validate that the `getLanguage` method returns the correct language value that has been previously set.
    Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a class instance and set a known value for the language variable.
    Act: Call the `getLanguage` method on the instance.
    Assert: Check if the returned value from `getLanguage` matches the known value initially set.
    Validation:
      The assertion intends to verify the correct functionality of the `getLanguage` method.
      This test is important as it ensures that the method fetches and returns the correct language value which is vital for the application's localization process.


Scenario 2: Validating method output when no language value has been set
  Details:
    TestName: testGetLanguageOnEmptyValue
    Description: The test verifies the functionality of `getLanguage` method when no value has been set for the language variable.
    Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a class instance without setting a value for the language variable.
    Act: Call `getLanguage` method on the instance.
    Assert: Check if the returned value from `getLanguage` is null.
    Validation:
      This assertion aims to ensure that the `getLanguage` method returns a null value if no value has been set for the language variable.
      This test scenario is crucial as it checks the behavior of the method during one of the potential edge cases.

Scenario 3: Validation GetLanguage method when language is set to a string with spaces
  Details:
    TestName: testGetLanguageForStringWithSpaces
    Description: This test aims to confirm if the `getLanguage` method preserves the spaces set in the language variable.
    Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a class instance and set a value with spaces for the language variable.
    Act: Call `getLanguage` method on the instance.
    Assert: Check if the returned value from `getLanguage` includes the spaces initially set.
    Validation:
      The assertion seeks to confirm the correct functionality of the `getLanguage` method on edge cases scenarios involving strings with spaces.
      This test scenario is important because it ensures the method maintains string integrity even when presented with non-traditional input.
