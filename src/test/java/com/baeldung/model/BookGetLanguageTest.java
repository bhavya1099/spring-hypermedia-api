Scenario 1: Test to check if getLanguage method returns the correct language of the book

Details:
  TestName: testGetLanguageReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getLanguage method is returning the correct language of the book.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class and use the setLanguage method to set a specific language.
  Act: Invoke the getLanguage method on the created book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned language against the language set initially.
Validation:
  The assertion is aimed to verify that the getLanguage method is functioning as expected and returns the correct language of the book. This is important to ensure that the correct language is retrieved when the method is invoked.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getLanguage method returns null when no language is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetLanguageReturnsNullWhenNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getLanguage method returns null when no language is set for the book.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class without setting a language.
  Act: Invoke the getLanguage method on the created book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned language is null.
Validation:
  The assertion is aimed to verify that the getLanguage method returns null when no language is set. This is important to ensure that the method behaves as expected when no language is set for the book.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getLanguage method returns the last set language of the book

Details:
  TestName: testGetLanguageReturnsLastSetValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getLanguage method is returning the last set language of the book.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class and use the setLanguage method to set a specific language. Then set a different language.
  Act: Invoke the getLanguage method on the created book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned language against the last set language.
Validation:
  The assertion is aimed to verify that the getLanguage method is functioning as expected and returns the last set language of the book. This is important to ensure that the correct language is retrieved when the method is invoked.
