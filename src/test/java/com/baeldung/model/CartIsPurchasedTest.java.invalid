Scenario 1: Verify isPurchased returns false for a newly created Cart

  Details:  
    TestName: checkIsPurchasedForNewCart
    Description: This test aims to verify that the method isPurchased returns false when it's checked on a newly created Cart object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A fresh Cart object is initialized.
    Act: The method isPurchased is invoked on the Cart object.
    Assert: An assertion is made that the result of the method invocation is false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks if the boolean returned by the method is false. This is because when a Cart is initiated, it is empty and nothing has been purchased yet.


Scenario 2: Verify isPurchased returns false after a book has been added to the Cart

  Details:  
    TestName: checkIsPurchasedAfterAddingBook
    Description: The test is designed to verify that the method isPurchased returns false even after a book has been added to the Cart.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A Cart object is instantiated and a Book object is added to it.
    Act: The method isPurchased is invoked on the Cart object.
    Assert: An assertion is made that the returned value is false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion validates that adding a book to the cart does not change the purchase status. Therefore, even after adding a book to the cart, isPurchased should return false due to no confirmed purchase operation.

Scenario 3: Verify isPurchased returns true after a book has been marked as purchased

  Details:  
    TestName: checkIsPurchasedAfterMarkingPurchased
    Description: This test checks if a Cart's isPurchased method returns true after the setPurchased method is used to mark it as purchased.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An object of Cart is created, a book is added to it and setPurchased method is invoked to mark it as purchased.
    Act: The method isPurchased is invoked on the Cart object.
    Assert: An assertion is made that the method returns true.
  Validation: 
    The test aims to validate that once the setPurchased method marks a Cart as purchased, the isPurchased method should return true reflecting this update.
