Scenario 1: Testing Happy Path Set Synopsis

Details:
  TestName: testSetSynopsisWithValidString.
  Description: This test is meant to verify that setSynopsis correctly assigns the provided string to the synopsis variable.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string with a valid text that we will pass in setSynopsis.
    Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method with the created string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the actual synopsis variable is equal to the created string.
  Validation:
    The assertion in this test verifies that setSynopsis correctly assigns and stores given value. If successful, this assured us that the method setSynopsis works as expected in the normal scenario.

Scenario 2: Setting Synopsis with Empty String

Details:
  TestName: testSetSynopsisWithEmptyString.
  Description: This test verifies that setSynopsis can handle and correctly assign when an empty string is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method with the empty string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the synopsis variable is an empty string.
  Validation:
    This assertion will verify that setSynopsis can handle and correctly assign an empty string. Passing the test would mean that setSynopsis can handle scenarios where no value is provided.

Scenario 3: Testing null Value Set Synopsis

Details:
  TestName: testSetSynopsisWithNullValue.
  Description: This test checks how the method setSynopsis responds when null is provided as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required for this case.
    Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method with null.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the synopsis variable is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify the functionality of setSynopsis when null is provided as input. If the method correctly assigns null to the synopsis variable, we can understand that it handles null inputs without causing any errors. This is important as entries in the database might sometimes be null, and this helps prevent Null Pointer Exceptions.

Scenario 4: Setting a Long String Synopsis

Details:
  TestName: testSetSynopsisWithLongString.
  Description: This will test if there is a limit to the characters we can assign as synopsis.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string of length longer than typical synopsis lengths.
    Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method with the created long string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the synopsis variable was assigned the long string.
  Validation:
    Our assertion will verify if there's a character limit to a synopsis, as longer synopses may cause problems in the system or the database. Passing this test assures us that our system can handle lengthy synopsis inputs.
