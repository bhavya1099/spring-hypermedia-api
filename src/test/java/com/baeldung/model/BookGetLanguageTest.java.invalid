Scenario 1: Testing getLanguage method for Null Values 
Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageForNullValue. 
  Description: This test will check the functionality of the getLanguage method when the language of the book has not been set (null).   
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book instance without setting the language.
  Act: Invoke getLanguage method on the book instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  Expected result is Null because the language was not set for the book. This test validates that getLanguage method can handle null values correctly.


Scenario 2: Retrieve Language of the Book
Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageOfBook.
  Description: This test will check if the getLanguage method is able to correctly return the language of a book that has been set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book instance and set its language.
  Act: Invoke getLanguage method on the book instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned language matches the one set.
Validation:
  Expected result is the language that was set for the Book. This test validates the core functionality of the getLanguage method.


Scenario 3: Modifying the Language of the Book
Details:  
  TestName: testModifyLanguageOfBook.
  Description: This test will check if modifying the language of the book using the setLanguage method is correctly reflected when the getLanguage method is subsequently called. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book instance, set its language, and changes its language.
  Act: Invoke getLanguage method on the book instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned language matches the modified one.
Validation:
  Expected result is the modified language that was set for the book after modification. This test validates that the getLanguage method accurately reflects language changes. 


Scenario 4: Checking Consistency of getLanguage
Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageConsistency.
  Description: This test will check if multiple calls to the getLanguage method return consistent values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book instance and set its language.
  Act: Invoke getLanguage method for multiple times on the book instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned language is the same across multiple calls.
Validation:
  The expected result is consistent language value across multiple calls. This test ensures that getLanguage method provides stable results and any internal state does not affect its outcome.
  
Scenario 5: Testing getLanguage with Multiple Language Codes 
Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageWithLanguageCodes
  Description: This test checks if the method "getLanguage" works correctly with multiple language codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book instance and set its language with different codes (ISO 639 codes).
  Act: Invoke getLanguage method on the book instance.
  Assert: Check if the returned language is the same as the set language code.
Validation:
  Expected result is the language codes set for the book. This test validates that getLanguage method can handle and correctly return multiple language codes.
