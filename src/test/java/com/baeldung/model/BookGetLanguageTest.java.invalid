Scenario 1: Test to check if getLanguage method returns the correct language of the book

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getLanguage method is returning the correct language of the book. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class and use the setLanguage method to set a specific language.
  Act: Invoke the getLanguage method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned language against the language that was set.
Validation: 
  The assertion is aimed to verify that the getLanguage method is working as expected and returns the correct language of the book. This is important to ensure that the correct language is retrieved when the method is invoked.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getLanguage method returns null when no language is set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageReturnsNullWhenNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getLanguage method returns null when the language of the book is not set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class without setting the language.
  Act: Invoke the getLanguage method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned language is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion is aimed to verify that the getLanguage method returns null when the language of the book is not set. This is significant to ensure that the method handles cases where the language is not set and returns null as expected.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getLanguage method returns the latest language when language is updated

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLanguageReturnsUpdatedValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getLanguage method returns the updated language when the language of the book is updated. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class and use the setLanguage method to set a specific language. Then update the language using the setLanguage method again.
  Act: Invoke the getLanguage method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned language against the updated language.
Validation: 
  The assertion is aimed to verify that the getLanguage method returns the latest language when the language of the book is updated. This is crucial to ensure that the method retrieves the updated language when invoked.
