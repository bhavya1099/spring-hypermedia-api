ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getId_4911fca10a

Scenario 1: Test to verify if the getId() method returns the correct ID set for the Book object.

  Details:  
    TestName: testReturnCorrectId
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getId() method is returning the correct ID that was previously set for a particular Book object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Book object and set an arbitrary ID using the setId() method.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on the Book object.
    Assert: Assert that the result returned by the getId() method is equal to the ID that was originally set.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to ensure that the getId() method behaves as expected, by returning the ID that was set for the Book object. This is important for identifying individual books in the system.

Scenario 2: Test to verify if the getId() method returns null when the ID is not set for the Book object.

  Details:  
    TestName: testReturnNullWhenIdNotSet
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getId() method returns null when the Id is not set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Book object without setting an ID.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on the Book object.
    Assert: Assert that the result returned by the getId() method is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getId() method correctly handles the case when the book's ID is not set. This can occur when a book object is newly created and its ID is not yet set. 

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getId() method returns unique IDs for different Book objects.

  Details:  
    TestName: testReturnUniqueIdsForDifferentBooks
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getId() method returns unique IDs for different Book objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different Book objects and set distinct IDs for each one.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on each Book object.
    Assert: Assert that the two IDs returned by the getId() method are not equal.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getId() method returns unique IDs for different Book objects, which is crucial for the correct identification and differentiation of individual books.
