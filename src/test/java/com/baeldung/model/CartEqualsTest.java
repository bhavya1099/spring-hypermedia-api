Scenario 1: Test for Object Equality

Details:
  TestName: testForSelfEquality
  Description: The test verifies that an object is equal to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object.
  Act: Compare the Cart object to itself.
  Assert: Assert that the outcome is true.
Validation:
  An object must always be equal to itself. If this is not the case, it will violate the reflexivity property in equals method contract of any Java Object.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Objects

Details:
  TestName: testForNullObject
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when supplied with a null object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null Cart object.
  Act: Compare another Cart object to the null object.
  Assert: Assert that the outcome is false.
Validation:
  An object should not be equal to null. If not, the equals method would not comply with Javaâ€™s equivalency contract.

Scenario 3: Test for Equality with Different Classes

Details:
  TestName: testForDifferentClasses
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when comparing objects of two different classes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object and an object of a different class.
  Act: Compare the Cart object to the other class object.
  Assert: Assert that the outcome is false.
Validation:
  Objects of different types should not be treated as equals, even if they have identical data.

Scenario 4: Test for Different Books

Details:
  TestName: testForDifferentBooks
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly recognizes when two Cart objects contain different books.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with different books.
  Act: Compare the two Cart objects.
  Assert: Assert the result is false.
Validation:
  Two Cart objects should not be equal if they contain different books. This verifies the method's ability to correctly distinguish between different books.

Scenario 5: Test for Same Books

Details:
  TestName: testForSameBooks
  Description: This test ensures the function correctly recognizes when two cart objects contain the same books.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with the same books.
  Act: Compare the two Cart objects.
  Assert: Assert the result is true.
Validation:
  Two Cart objects should be equal if they contain the exact same books. It validates the method's ability to correctly identify identical books.

Scenario 6: Test for Purchase Status

Details:
  TestName: testForPurchaseStatus
  Description: This test ensures the function correctly recognizes when two cart objects have the same purchased status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with the same purchased status.
  Act: Compare the two Cart objects.
  Assert: Assert the result is true.
Validation:
  Two Cart objects with the same purchased status should be equal. It validates the method's ability to correctly identify the same status.
