"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify if two cart objects are equal when their properties are identical.

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithIdenticalCarts
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies two carts as being equal when their properties are identical.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two cart objects with the same books and purchased status.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using one cart as the parameter for the other.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that two carts with identical properties are considered equal by the equals method. This is important for ensuring the consistency and correctness of cart comparisons in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to verify if two cart objects are not equal when their properties are different.

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentCarts
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies two carts as being not equal when their properties are different.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two cart objects with different books and purchased status.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using one cart as the parameter for the other.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that two carts with different properties are not considered equal by the equals method. This is important for ensuring the accuracy of cart comparisons in the application.

Scenario 3: Test to verify if the equals method correctly identifies a cart object as not equal to null.

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNull
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies a cart as not equal to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a cart object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using null as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a cart is not considered equal to null by the equals method. This is important for ensuring that the equals method correctly handles null values.

Scenario 4: Test to verify if the equals method correctly identifies a cart object as equal to itself.

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSelf
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies a cart as equal to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a cart object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using the cart itself as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a cart is considered equal to itself by the equals method. This is crucial for maintaining the reflexivity property of the equals method in the application.
