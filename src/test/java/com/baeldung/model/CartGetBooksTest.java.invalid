"""
Scenario 1: Verify the addition of books into the cart

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfBook
  Description: The test is meant to check the add() functionality and validate that books are being added correctly into the cart.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Book instance and a Cart instance.
  Act: Invoke add() method on the Cart instance with the Book instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the book list from getBooks()' output with expected book list object.

Validation: 
  Validates that the book list retrieved from the cart using getBooks() method contains the added book.
  This is essential to ensure the add() functionality in the Cart class works correctly.
  
Scenario 2: Validate retrieval of books from an empty cart

Details:  
  TestName: testGetBooksFromEmptyCart
  Description: The test is designed to verify the getBooks() method when the cart is empty.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Cart with no books added.
  Act: Retrieve the list of books in the cart by invoking getBooks() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned list is empty.

Validation:
  The test aims to validate that getBooks() returns an empty list when no books have been added to the cart. 
  This is crucial to handle scenarios where the cart is empty without any error.

Scenario 3: Test the Cart's ability to retrieve books after making purchase

Details:  
  TestName: testGetBooksAfterPurchase
  Description: The test ensures that getBooks() correctly retrieves books from the cart even after a purchase has been made.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Cart, add some books, and set the purchased flag to true.
  Act: Invoke getBooks() method to retrieve the list of books.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the retrieved list of books with the expected list of books.

Validation: 
  The test aims to confirm that even after making a purchase, the cart still has a record of the books that were purchased. 
  This is critical for providing purchase history to the users.
