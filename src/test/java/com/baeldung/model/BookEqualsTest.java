Scenario 1: Testing with Identical Instances

Details:
  TestName: testingWithIdenticalInstances
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies and returns true when the same instance of a book is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book instance and pass it to the equals method.
  Act: Invoke equals on the book instance.
  Assert: The method should return true.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the equals method can successfully identify and return true when the same instance of the book is passed as an argument. It helps validate if the equals method provides reliable equality checks.

Scenario 2: Testing with Null

Details:
  TestName: testingWithNull
  Description: This test checks how the equals method responds when a null object is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Invoke the equals method on the book instance, passing null as the argument.
  Act: Invoke equals on the book instance.
  Assert: The method should return false.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the equals method to handle incorrect input values(null), showing it correctly identifies and returns false when null is passed.

Scenario 3: Testing with Different Class

Details:
  TestName: testingWithDifferentClass
  Description: This test checks the equals method's behavior when an object of a different class is provided as the parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of a different class and feed it to the equals method.
  Act: Invoke equals on the book instance.
  Assert: The method should return false.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the equals method correctly identifies and returns false when it's given an object of a different class, validating that the equals method assesses the class of the objects correctly.

Scenario 4: Testing with Different Authors

Details:
  TestName: testingWithDifferentAuthors
  Description: This test checks the equals method's behavior when the author field of the book instances are different.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two book instances with different authors and compare them.
  Act: Invoke equals on the book instance.
  Assert: The method should return false.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies and returns false when the authors of the two book instances are different. Hence, the test assures that the equals method can efficiently check for author equivalency.

Scenario 5: Testing with Different ISBNS

Details:
  TestName: testingWithDifferentIsbns
  Description: This test checks the equals method's behavior when the ISBNs of the book instances are different.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two book instances with different ISBNs and compare them.
  Act: Invoke equals on the book instance.
  Assert: The method should return false.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the equals method can correctly differentiate between two book instances with non-identical ISBNs, asserting that the equals method provides precise ISBN equivalency checks.

Scenario 6: Testing with Equal Books

Details:
  TestName: testingWithEqualBooks
  Description: This test is designed to validate the standard behavior of the equals method when two identical book instances are compared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two equal book instances and compare them.
  Act: Invoke equals on the book instance.
  Assert: The method should return true.
Validation:
  This test validates the intended function of the equals method, which should return true when comparing two identical book instances. This ensures that the equals method implements correct equality logic.
