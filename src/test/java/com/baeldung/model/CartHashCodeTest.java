ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_24d856d52f

Scenario 1: Test to check the hashCode value when the Cart is empty and not purchased
  Details:
    TestName: testEmptyCartNotPurchasedHashCode
    Description: This test checks the hashCode value when the Cart is empty and not purchased. It is expected to return the default hashCode value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty Cart and make sure it is not purchased.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashCode is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns the default value for an empty Cart that is not purchased. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the hashCode method in such scenarios.

Scenario 2: Test to check the hashCode value when the Cart is empty but purchased
  Details:
    TestName: testEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode
    Description: This test checks the hashCode value when the Cart is empty but purchased. It is expected to return a different hashCode value than the default one.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty Cart and set it as purchased.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashCode is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns a different value for an empty Cart that is purchased. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the hashCode method in such scenarios.

Scenario 3: Test to check the hashCode value when the Cart has books and is not purchased
  Details:
    TestName: testNonEmptyCartNotPurchasedHashCode
    Description: This test checks the hashCode value when the Cart has books and is not purchased. It is expected to return a different hashCode value than the default one and the one for an empty Cart.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Cart, add some books to it and make sure it is not purchased.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashCode is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns a different value for a Cart that has books and is not purchased. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the hashCode method in such scenarios.

Scenario 4: Test to check the hashCode value when the Cart has books and is purchased
  Details:
    TestName: testNonEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode
    Description: This test checks the hashCode value when the Cart has books and is purchased. It is expected to return a unique hashCode value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Cart, add some books to it and set it as purchased.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashCode is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns a unique value for a Cart that has books and is purchased. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the hashCode method in such scenarios.

/*
The error message indicates that the expected value of the hashCode, which was set to 1237, does not match the actual hashCode that was returned when the test was run, which was 2229. 

This discrepancy is due to the way the hashCode is calculated in the business logic method. The hashCode for a Cart object is calculated based on the 'books' field and the 'purchased' field. 

In this test case, we are creating a new Cart object with an empty 'books' list and 'purchased' set to false. When the hashCode is calculated, the 'books' list, being empty, will yield a hashCode of 1 (since 31 * 1 + 0 = 1). The 'purchased' field, being false, will result in the hash code calculation adding 1237 to the result. 

However, the overall hashCode will not be 1237 because the hash of the 'books' list (empty in this case) is also involved in the calculation. The hashCode for an empty list in Java is 1, so the final hashCode will be different from the expected 1237. 

In conclusion, the test is failing because it's not correctly accounting for the hash of the 'books' list in the expected hashCode.

/*
The test `testEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode()` is failing because it's expecting the hashcode of the `Cart` object to be `1231`. However, the actual hashcode returned by the `hashCode()` method in `Cart` class is `2223`.

In the `hashCode()` method of the `Cart` class, the hashcode is calculated based on the `books` field and the `purchased` field. The `books` field is a list of `Book` objects and its hashcode is calculated based on its elements. If `books` is null, its hashcode is considered as `0`. The `purchased` field is a boolean and its hashcode is calculated as `1231` if it's `true` and `1237` if it's `false`.

In your test, you're creating a new `Cart` object with an empty `books` list and setting `purchased` as `true`. Therefore, the hashcode should be the sum of the hashcode of an empty list (which is `1`) and `1231` (the hashcode for `true`), multiplied by a prime number `31`. 

However, the test is expecting the hashcode to be `1231`, which is not correct because it's not taking into consideration the hashcode of the `books` list. As a result, the test assertion fails because the expected value `1231` is not equal to the actual value `2223`.

So, the failure is due to the incorrect expectation in the test case. The test case should be corrected to calculate the expected hashcode properly considering the hashcode of both `books` and `purchased` fields.
@Test
@Category(Categories.valid.class)
public void testEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode() {
    Cart cart = new Cart();
    cart.setPurchased(true);
    int expectedHashCode = 1231;
    Assert.assertEquals(expectedHashCode, cart.hashCode());
}

/*
The testNonEmptyCartNotPurchasedHashCode() test case is failing because the expected and actual hashcode values do not match.

In the test case, you have created a Cart object and added a Book to it. However, when you calculate the expected hashcode, you're using an empty ArrayList<Book>(). This will not match the hashcode of the Cart object, which contains a Book.

The Cart's hashcode is calculated based on its 'books' field (a list of Book objects) and a 'purchased' field. Specifically, the hashcode of the 'books' field is taken into account, which in turn depends on the hashcode of the Book objects in the list. Since you've added a Book object to the Cart, the hashcode of the 'books' field in the Cart will not be the same as the hashcode of an empty ArrayList<Book>().

As a result, when the test case asserts that the expected hashcode (based on an empty ArrayList<Book>()) should be equal to the actual hashcode (based on a Cart with one Book), it fails.
@Test
@Category(Categories.valid.class)
public void testNonEmptyCartNotPurchasedHashCode() {
    Cart cart = new Cart();
    cart.add(new Book("Author1", "Title1", "ISBN1"));

    int expectedHashCode = new ArrayList<Book>().hashCode() + 1237;
    Assert.assertEquals(expectedHashCode, cart.hashCode());

/*
The test `testNonEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode()` is failing due to the incorrect expectation of the hashCode of the `Cart` object.

In the test, you have created a `Cart` object and added a `Book` object to it. You also set the `purchased` field of the `Cart` object to `true`. You then calculate the expected hashCode as the hashCode of an empty `ArrayList<Book>` plus `1231`.

However, the `hashCode()` method in the `Cart` class calculates the hash code based on the `books` field and the `purchased` field. Since you added a `Book` object to the `Cart`, the `books` field is not null and not empty. Therefore, the hash code of the `books` field is not equal to the hash code of an empty `ArrayList<Book>`.

The error message `expected:<1232> but was:<-642870898>` indicates that the expected hash code (calculated as the hash code of an empty `ArrayList<Book>` plus `1231`) does not match the actual hash code of the `Cart` object.

In conclusion, the test is failing because it does not correctly calculate the expected hash code. The expected hash code should be calculated based on the actual content of the `Cart` object, including the `Book` object added to it and the `purchased` field set to `true`.
