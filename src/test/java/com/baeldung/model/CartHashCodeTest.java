```
Scenario 1: Empty cart with default values

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithEmptyCart
  Description: This test will verify the hashCode method when no books are added and the purchase status is false (default). It checks the consistency of the hash code value for an unaltered cart.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new Cart object with no modifications.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the new Cart object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code matches the expected hash code calculated for a cart with no books and purchase status false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The default hash code should reflect the state of an untouched Cart object, ensuring that the hash code generation logic accounts for null books and the default purchase status.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensuring consistent hash codes for default object states is crucial for reliable storage and lookup functionality in data structures like hash maps.

Scenario 2: Cart with multiple books added

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithMultipleBooks
  Description: Tests the hashCode method on a cart that contains a list of books to ensure that the hash code changes appropriately as books are added.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart and add multiple Book objects to it using the add(Book bookToAdd) method.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Assert that the hash code is as expected after adding multiple books, which should be different from an empty cart's hash code.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Checks that the hash code correctly incorporates the hash codes of the books in the list.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Accurate hash code generation when multiple items are present is essential to maintain the integrity and performance of hash-based collections.

Scenario 3: Cart purchased status changed

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithPurchasedStatus
  Description: Verifies how the hashCode method reflects changes when the purchased status of the cart is toggled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new Cart object and use the setPurchased method to change the purchased status to true.
  Act: Call the hashCode method.
  Assert: Check that the hash code reflects the change in the purchased status.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: To ensure the hash code is properly updated when there is a change in the boolean state of the purchased field.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: It's crucial for the hash code to accurately represent the object's state in scenarios where boolean values affect application flow or data management.

Scenario 4: Cart with null books and purchased true

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithNullBooksAndPurchasedTrue
  Description: This scenario tests the hash code calculation when the books list is explicitly set to null and the purchased status is true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a Cart object with no books (null) and set the purchased status to true.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Validate that the hash code matches the expected value considering no books and a purchased status of true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Ensures that the hash code handles null values for list type fields and correctly computes with boolean fields.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Proper handling of null lists in conjunction with other fields affects consistency and error handling in complex data structures.
