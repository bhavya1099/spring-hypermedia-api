ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashCode_79c7740116
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_24d856d52f

Scenario 1: Test to check the hashCode value when the Cart is empty and not purchased
  Details:
    TestName: testEmptyCartNotPurchasedHashCode
    Description: This test checks the hashCode value when the Cart is empty and not purchased. It is expected to return the default hashCode value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty Cart and make sure it is not purchased.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashCode is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns the default value for an empty Cart that is not purchased. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the hashCode method in such scenarios.

Scenario 2: Test to check the hashCode value when the Cart is empty but purchased
  Details:
    TestName: testEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode
    Description: This test checks the hashCode value when the Cart is empty but purchased. It is expected to return a different hashCode value than the default one.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty Cart and set it as purchased.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashCode is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns a different value for an empty Cart that is purchased. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the hashCode method in such scenarios.

Scenario 3: Test to check the hashCode value when the Cart has books and is not purchased
  Details:
    TestName: testNonEmptyCartNotPurchasedHashCode
    Description: This test checks the hashCode value when the Cart has books and is not purchased. It is expected to return a different hashCode value than the default one and the one for an empty Cart.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Cart, add some books to it and make sure it is not purchased.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashCode is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns a different value for a Cart that has books and is not purchased. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the hashCode method in such scenarios.

Scenario 4: Test to check the hashCode value when the Cart has books and is purchased
  Details:
    TestName: testNonEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode
    Description: This test checks the hashCode value when the Cart has books and is purchased. It is expected to return a unique hashCode value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Cart, add some books to it and set it as purchased.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashCode is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns a unique value for a Cart that has books and is purchased. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the hashCode method in such scenarios.
