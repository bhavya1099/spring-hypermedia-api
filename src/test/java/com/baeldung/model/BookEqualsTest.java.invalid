Scenario 1: Check Equality With Itself 
Details:
    TestName: testEqualityWithItself
    Description: The aim of this test is to verify that a book object is equivalent to itself. 
  Execution: 
    Arrange: We create a book object and set up its properties.
    Act: We invoke the equals method, comparing the book object to itself.
    Assert: We assert that the result should be "true".
  Validation: 
    This verifies that the equals method works correctly when the same object is compared to itself. The comparison result should be true as per Java's contract for the equals() method. 

Scenario 2: Check Null Inequality
Details:
    TestName: testNullInequality 
    Description: This test checks whether the equals method correctly identifies that a book is not equivalent to null. 
  Execution: 
    Arrange: We create a book object and set up its properties.
    Act: We pass null as a parameter to the equals method.
    Assert: We assert that the result of the equals method should be "false".
  Validation: 
    This verifies that the equals method correctly identifies a null object as not being equal to the book object. According to the equals() contract in Java, any object is not equal to null.

Scenario 3: Check Inequality with Different Class
Details:
    TestName: testInequalityWithDifferentClass
    Description: This test verifies whether the equals method marks the book object as not equal to an object of a different class.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: We create a book object and an object from a different class.
    Act: We pass the object of a different class to the equals method.
    Assert: We assert that the result of the equals method is "false".
  Validation: 
    This validates that the equals method correctly identifies an object from a different class as not being equal to the book object. As per Java's equals() contract, objects of different classes are not considered equal.

Scenario 4: Check Equality with Different Object with Same Details
Details: 
    TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentObjectSameDetails
    Description: This test checks whether the equals method identifies two distinct book objects with the same details as equal.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: We create two different book objects and set them up with the same details.
    Act: We invoke the equals method, comparing the first book object to the second one.
    Assert: We assert that the result of the equals method is "true".
  Validation: 
    This validates whether the equals method can correctly determine equality for two different book objects with identical details. According to the equals() contract in Java, two objects are considered equal if they have the same details.
