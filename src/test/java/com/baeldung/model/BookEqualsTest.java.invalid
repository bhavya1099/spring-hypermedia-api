Scenario 1: Test for the equality of two identical Book objects

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualityOfIdenticalBooks.
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the equals() method correctly identifies two identical Book objects as equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical Book objects with identical author, title, and ISBN.
  Act: Invoke the equals() method with the second Book object as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals() method returns true.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals() method correctly identifies two identical Book objects as equal. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the equals() method.

Scenario 2: Test for the inequality of two different Book objects

Details:  
  TestName: testInequalityOfDifferentBooks.
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the equals() method correctly identifies two different Book objects as not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects with different author, title, or ISBN.
  Act: Invoke the equals() method with the second Book object as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals() method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals() method correctly identifies two different Book objects as not equal. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the equals() method.

Scenario 3: Test for book object equality with null

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualityWithNull.
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the equals() method correctly identifies a Book object and null as not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object and a null object.
  Act: Invoke the equals() method with the null object as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals() method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals() method correctly identifies a Book object and null as not equal. This test is significant as it verifies the null safety of the equals() method.

Scenario 4: Test for book object equality with different class object

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentClassObject.
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the equals() method correctly identifies a Book object and an object of a different class as not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object and an object of a different class.
  Act: Invoke the equals() method with the object of a different class as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals() method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals() method correctly identifies a Book object and an object of a different class as not equal. This test is significant as it validates the type safety of the equals() method.
