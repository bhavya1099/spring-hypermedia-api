Scenario 1: Testing getTitle Method For Valid Result

Details:
    TestName: testGetTitleForValidResult
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getTitle method is capable of returning a valid title when called.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class object containing the getTitle method.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method, assumably after setting the title value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertion methods like assertEquals() to compare the actual output of the getTitle method with the expected output.
Validation:
    This assertion is meant to verify that the getTitle method works as it's expected to. If the title value is already set, getTitle should be able to return it adequately.

Scenario 2: Testing getTitle Method For Null Result

Details:
    TestName: testGetTitleForNullResult
    Description: This test checks if the getTitle method is capable of handling situations where the title hasn't been set or initialized, hence it's null.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class object containing the getTitle method, without setting its title value.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertion methods like assertNull() to check if the return value of the getTitle method is null.
Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify if the getTitle method can adequately return a null value when the title has not been set or initialized. This is important as it ensures robust exception handling in the application.

Scenario 3: Testing getTitle Method For Empty Title

Details:
    TestName: testGetTitleForEmptyTitle
    Description: This test assesses if the getTitle method can handle situations where the title is an empty string.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class object containing the getTitle method, setting its title value to "".
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertion methods like assertEquals() to check if the return value of getTitle is an empty string.
Validation:
    This assertion verifies if the getTitle method can handle a scenario where the title is an empty string. This is key in maintaining the integrity of the application, ensuring it can adequately handle various possible edge cases.

Scenario 4: Testing getTitle Method Post Multi-Threading

Details:
    TestName: testGetTitlePostMultiThreading
    Description: This test is intended to check if the getTitle method still provides valid results after multiple threads have interacted with the instance containing the getTitle method.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class object containing the getTitle method and set up multiple threads to interact with the object, elevating chances for race conditions.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method after the conclusion of threads execution.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertion methods to compare the actual output of the getTitle method with the expected output post multi-threading.
Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that getTitle maintains consistent behavior in a concurrent environment and is thread-safe. It is crucial for ensuring the robustness of the application in a multi-threaded context.
