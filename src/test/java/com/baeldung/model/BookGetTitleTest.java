  Scenario 1: Test to Validate Return Value

  Details:
    TestName: testGetTitleReturnsValue.
    Description: This test aims to check whether the getTitle() method returns the correct title as set in the object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object of the class and set a title for it.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle() method on the object.
    Assert: Compare the returned value with the title we set earlier.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getTitle() method returns the correct title. The expected result is the title we set initially, as the getTitle() method should return that. This is important to ensure that the method is working as expected and returning the correct title.

  Scenario 2: Test to Validate Null Return Value

  Details:
    TestName: testGetTitleReturnsNull.
    Description: This test aims to check whether the getTitle() method returns null if no title is set in the object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object of the class without setting a title.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle() method on the object.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getTitle() method returns null if no title is set. The expected result is null, as no title was set in the object. This is important to check the behavior of the method when no title is set.

  Scenario 3: Test to Validate Return Value with Special Characters

  Details:
    TestName: testGetTitleReturnsValueWithSpecialCharacters.
    Description: This test aims to check whether the getTitle() method returns the correct title with special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object of the class and set a title with special characters for it.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle() method on the object.
    Assert: Compare the returned value with the title we set earlier.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getTitle() method returns the correct title even if it contains special characters. The expected result is the title we set initially, as the getTitle() method should return that. This is important to ensure that the method handles titles with special characters correctly.
