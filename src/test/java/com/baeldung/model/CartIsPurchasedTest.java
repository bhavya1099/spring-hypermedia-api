"""
Scenario 1: Testing the return value when the item is purchased

Details:
  TestName: isItemPurchased
  Description: The test is meant to check if the method correctly returns true when the item is marked as purchased.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a condition where the 'purchased' variable is set to true.
  Act: Invoke the 'isPurchased' method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned result is true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method accurately reflects whether the item has been purchased or not. The expected result is true, as we set 'purchased' to true for this scenario. This test is significant to ensure accurate tracking of purchased items in the system.

Scenario 2: Testing the return value when the item is not purchased

Details:
  TestName: isItemNotPurchased
  Description: The test is meant to check if the method correctly returns false when the item is not marked as purchased.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a condition where the 'purchased' variable is set to false.
  Act: Invoke the 'isPurchased' method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method accurately reflects whether the item has been purchased or not. The expected result is false, as we set 'purchased' to false for this scenario. This test is important to make sure that not-yet-purchased items are correctly registered in the system.

Scenario 3: Testing the default value of the method

Details:
  TestName: isItemPurchasedDefaultValue
  Description: The test is meant to check if the method correctly returns the default value when the 'purchased' variable is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangements need to be made, the 'purchased' variable is left unset.
  Act: Invoke the 'isPurchased' method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned result matches the default value of the 'purchased' variable in the system.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'isPurchased' method accurately returns the default value when 'purchased' is not set. The test is important for validating that unassigned variables do not interfere negatively with system functionality.
