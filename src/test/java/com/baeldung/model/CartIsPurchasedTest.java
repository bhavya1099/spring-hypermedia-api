Scenario 1: isPurchased Method Returns True

Details:
  TestName: isPurchasedReturnsTrue
  Description: This test verifies if the isPurchased method returns true when the Cart is marked as purchased.

  Act: Invoke the isPurchased method on the Cart instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the isPurchased method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the isPurchased method accurately returns the purchased status of the Cart. If a Cart is not marked as purchased, the isPurchased method should return false. This is important for correctly identifying Carts that are not yet purchased.

Scenario 3: isPurchased Method Handles Empty Cart

Details:
  TestName: isPurchasedHandlesEmptyCart
  Description: This test ensures that the isPurchased method correctly handles an empty Cart.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Cart instance without adding any Books to it. Set the purchased status to true.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the isPurchased method correctly returns the purchased status of the Cart, even if the Cart is empty. An empty Cart can be marked as purchased, and the isPurchased method should correctly reflect this. This is essential for handling scenarios where a Cart may be purchased without any Books in it.
