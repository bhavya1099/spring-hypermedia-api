Based on the provided information, here are test scenarios for the `isPurchased()` method of the Cart class:

Scenario 1: Verify Default Purchase Status

Details:
  TestName: verifyDefaultPurchaseStatus
  Description: Check if a newly created Cart instance has the default purchase status of false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Cart instance.
  Act: Call the isPurchased() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test verifies that a new Cart starts with an unpurchased status. It's important to ensure the initial state is correct before any operations are performed on the cart.

Scenario 2: Verify Purchase Status After Setting to True

Details:
  TestName: verifyPurchaseStatusAfterSettingTrue
  Description: Ensure that the isPurchased() method returns true after setting the purchase status to true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Cart instance and set its purchase status to true using setPurchased(true).
  Act: Call the isPurchased() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the isPurchased() method correctly reflects changes made to the purchase status. It's crucial for tracking whether a cart has been processed for purchase.

Scenario 3: Verify Purchase Status After Setting to False

Details:
  TestName: verifyPurchaseStatusAfterSettingFalse
  Description: Ensure that the isPurchased() method returns false after setting the purchase status to false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Cart instance, set its purchase status to true, then set it back to false using setPurchased(false).
  Act: Call the isPurchased() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the isPurchased() method accurately reflects when a cart's purchase status is changed back to false. This could be important in scenarios where a purchase is cancelled or reset.

Scenario 4: Verify Purchase Status Consistency with Books Added

Details:
  TestName: verifyPurchaseStatusConsistencyWithBooksAdded
  Description: Ensure that adding books to the cart does not affect the purchase status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Cart instance, add a Book to the cart using the add() method.
  Act: Call the isPurchased() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the purchase status remains independent of the cart's contents. It's important to verify that adding items doesn't automatically change the purchase status.

Scenario 5: Verify Purchase Status in Equality Check

Details:
  TestName: verifyPurchaseStatusInEqualityCheck
  Description: Ensure that two Cart instances with different purchase statuses are not considered equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart instances. Set the purchase status of one to true and the other to false.
  Act: Compare the two Cart instances using the equals() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the comparison is false.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the purchase status is correctly considered in the equality check between Cart instances. It's important for maintaining the integrity of cart comparisons in the system.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the isPurchased() method, including its default behavior, state changes, interaction with other methods, and its role in object equality. They aim to ensure the method functions correctly in different contexts within the Cart class.
