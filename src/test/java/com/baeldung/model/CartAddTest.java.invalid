Scenario 1: Test Adding a Book to Cart
Details:  
  TestName: addBookToCart.
  Description: This test checks if a book can be successfully added to a cart. 
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of Cart containing an empty list of Books is set up.
  Act: The add method is invoked with an instance of Book as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the size of the book list in the cart increased by 1.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that the book was successfully added to the cart by checking if the size of the books list in the cart has increased. This is important to ensure functionality of adding books to the cart.

Scenario 2: Test Adding a Null Book to Cart
Details:  
  TestName: addNullBookToCart.
  Description: This test checks if a null book can be added to the cart and handles the null scenario. 
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of Cart containing an empty list of Books is set up.
  Act: The add method is invoked with a null Book.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the size of the book list in the cart remains the same.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that a null book is not added to the cart by checking if the size of the book list in the cart remains the same. This is important to avoid potential NullPointerException during runtime.

Scenario 3: Test Adding a Book to Purchased Cart
Details:  
  TestName: addBookToPurchasedCart.
  Description: This test checks if a Cart that has been marked as purchased can still add new books.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of Cart that is already marked as purchased is set up.
  Act: The add method is invoked with an instance of Book as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the size of the book list in the cart increased and whether the cart is still marked as purchased.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that a purchased cart can still add books by checking if the size of the book list in the cart has increased and if the purchased flag remains true. This is important for understanding the cart behavior after purchase.

Scenario 4: Test Adding a Book to Cart and Verify with GetBooks Method
Details:  
  TestName: addBookAndVerifyWithGetBooks.
  Description: This test ensures the added book can be retrieved using the getBooks method.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of Cart containing an empty list of Books is set up.
  Act: The add method is invoked with an instance of Book as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the list returned by getBooks contains the added Book.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that the book was successfully added and can be retrieved using the getBooks method. This is important to validate the add and getBooks methods interaction.

Scenario 5: Test Adding Duplicate Book to Cart
Details:  
  TestName: addDuplicateBookToCart.
  Description: This test checks if a duplicate book can be added to the cart.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of Cart containing a book is set up.
  Act: The add method is invoked with a duplicate of the already added book.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the duplicate book was added to the cart by checking the size of the book list.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that a cart can contain duplicate books. This is important to ensure a user can purchase multiple copies of a book.
