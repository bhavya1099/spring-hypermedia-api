Scenario 1: Testing setId method with normal id
Details:
  TestName: setIdWithNormalId
  Description: This test is meant to check that setId method sets the id properly when a normal id is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need for arrangement as no data, mocks or test doubles are used.
    Act: Invoke setId method with an id of type Long within normal expected range.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method does not throw exceptions, and that the id is set correctly by comparing it with the provided id.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method setId works correctly under normal conditions. The reason behind the expected result is the normal java object behavior, where the set method should assign the provided argument to the object's property.

Scenario 2: Testing setId method with null id
Details:
  TestName: setIdWithNullId
  Description: This test is meant to check how the setId method reacts when null is provided as an id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need for arrangement as no data, mocks or test doubles are used.
    Act: Invoke setId method with a null id.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method does not throw exceptions, and that the id is set to null.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method setId can handle null values without throwing exceptions. If the id is set to null, it implies that the method works as expected because in Java, null is a valid value for objects.

Scenario 3: Testing setId method with maximum limit value of long
Details:
  TestName: setIdWithMaxValueId
  Description: This test checks how the setId method behaves when it gets the maximum value that the long type can hold.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No preparation required as no additional data or objects are needed.
    Act: Call setId method with the maximum possible value of long.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to establish that the method doesn't throw exceptions and the id is correctly set to the maximum long value.
  Validation:
    The assertion hopes to verify that the setId method can handle the boundary case of long input without causing errors. If the id is set to the maximum long value, the method is confirmed to be effective and robust in handling extreme cases.

Scenario 4: Testing setId method with negative values
Details:
  TestName: setIdWithNegativeValue
  Description: This test checks whether negative values can be set as an id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required as no objects, data, or mocks are used.
    Act: Call setId method with a negative long value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the negative value was set correctly.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks whether the setId method can handle and set negative values correctly. The validity of the test depends on the actual application requirements for setting negative id values. This test is significant in showing the robustness and versatility of the setId method.
