Scenario 1: Test to verify correct author is returned

  Details:  
    TestName: checkCorrectAuthorIsReturned
    Description: This test verifies that the 'getAuthor' method returns the correct author that was set in the Book instance.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of Book and set an author name using setAuthor().
    Act: Invoke the getAuthor() method on the Book instance.
    Assert: Use assertEquals to match the returned author name with the expected author.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the 'getAuthor' method correctly returns the author set in the Book instance. This behavior is important as it ensures that the book's details are accurately handled and returned in the application.
  
Scenario 2: Test to verify null returned when no author is set

  Details:  
    TestName: checkNullWhenNoAuthorSet
    Description: This test is to check that the 'getAuthor' method returns null when no author is set in the Book. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of Book without setting up an author.
    Act: Invoke the getAuthor() method on the Book instance.
    Assert: Use assertNull to assert that the method returns null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion validates that the getAuthor method correctly returns null when no author is set. This can be utilized to validate and handle such scenarios in the application, where a book might not have an associated author.

Scenario 3: Test to verify returned author is immutable

  Details:  
    TestName: checkReturnedAuthorIsImmutable
    Description: This test verifies that the 'getAuthor' method returns an author that cannot be changed directly by modifying the returned value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of Book and set an author name using setAuthor().
    Act: Invoke the getAuthor() method on the Book instance and attempt to modify the author's value.
    Assert: Use assertEquals to ensure that the author's value in the Book instance has not changed.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is checking to ensure that manipulating the output of the getAuthor method does not directly change the data in the Book instance. In the context of application behavior, it's important to confirm the data's immutability for security and data integrity reasons.
