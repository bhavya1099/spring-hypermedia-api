Scenario 1: Testing the null return value of getSynopsis method

  Details:
    TestName: testGetSynopsisWhenSynopsisIsNull.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getSynopsis method returns null which is an acceptable outcome according to the business logic.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement needed as no input is provided to the method.
    Act: Invoke the getSynopsis method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the outcome is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the outcome is null which is an expected result when the synopsis has not been set. This signifies the normal behaviour of the method in the context of business logic.

Scenario 2: Testing a normal return value of getSynopsis method

  Details:
    TestName: testGetSynopsisWhenSynopsisIsNormal.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getSynopsis method returns the expected synopsis.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and set the synopsis as a regular string value.
    Act: Invoke the getSynopsis method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned synopsis is equal to the string value set.
  Validation:
    Here, the assertion verifies if the getSynopsis method is correctly returning the synopsis that has been set. This is important to ensure that the business logic of retrieving synopsis is functioning accurately.

Scenario 3: Testing for conversion of special characters

  Details:
    TestName: testGetSynopsisForSpecialCharacters.
    Description: This test aims to determine how getSynopsis method handles special characters in the input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and give the synopsis that contains special characters.
    Act: Invoke the getSynopsis method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned synopsis matches the initial string with the special characters.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the getSynopsis method accurately retrieves synopsis even when it contains special characters. This test is important to ensure that synopsis with all varieties of characters are handled correctly by the method.

Scenario 4: Test for empty string

  Details:
    TestName: testGetSynopsisForEmptyString.
    Description: This test checks the getSynopsis method when the synopsis is an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and set the synopsis as an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getSynopsis method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned synopsis is an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the getSynopsis method correctly retrieves an empty string for an empty synopsis. This is important to check the method's accuracy when dealing with empty values.
