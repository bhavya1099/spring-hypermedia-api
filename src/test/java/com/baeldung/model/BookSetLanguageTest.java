"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if language is being set correctly

Details:
  TestName: testValidLanguageSetting.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the input "language" is being correctly set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We create an object of the current class and take a valid language string eg. "English".
    Act: We invoke the setLanguage() method with the valid string.
    Assert: We use JUnit assertions to check if the language is being correctly set.
  Validation:
    This is to verify if the setLanguage function is working correctly. We expect the demonstration of correct language setting for the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check empty strings are handled gracefully

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyLanguageSetting.
  Description: This test is to check how the method behaves when an empty string is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We create an object of this class and keep the language string empty.
    Act: We call setLanguage() method with an empty string.
    Assert: We use JUnit assertions to check if the emptiness of the string is not affecting the original language value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify the correct language setting functionality even if the input string was empty. The value should remain unchanged.


Scenario 3: Test to handle nulls gracefully

Details:
  TestName: testNullLanguageSetting.
  Description: This test is to check how the method behaves when null is passed as the language.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We create an object of this class and prepare to pass null as language.
    Act: Invoke the setLanguage() method with null.
    Assert: We use JUnit assertions to check if the original value is not changed to null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the function is null-resistant. The value should remain unchanged even if the input was null.
