Based on the provided information, here are some test scenarios for the `getId()` method of the Book class:

```
Scenario 1: Retrieve ID of a Book with a Set ID

Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsSetValue
  Description: This test verifies that the getId() method correctly returns the ID value that has been set for a Book object.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Book object and set its ID using the setId() method.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Book object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID matches the value that was set.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the getId() method correctly retrieves the ID value that has been assigned to a Book object. It's crucial for maintaining data integrity and for operations that rely on accurate book identification.

Scenario 2: Retrieve ID of a Newly Created Book (Default Value)

Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsNullForNewBook
  Description: This test checks if the getId() method returns null for a newly created Book object that hasn't had its ID set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Book object without setting any values.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Book object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID is null.

Validation:
  This test confirms that a newly created Book object has a null ID by default. This is important for distinguishing between books that have been persisted (with an assigned ID) and those that are newly created in memory.

Scenario 3: Retrieve ID After Setting to Null

Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsNullAfterSettingToNull
  Description: This test verifies that the getId() method returns null after explicitly setting the ID to null.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object, set its ID to a non-null value, then set it back to null.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Book object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID is null.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the getId() method correctly handles cases where the ID is explicitly set to null. It's important for scenarios where a book's ID might be cleared or reset.

Scenario 4: Retrieve ID After Multiple Sets

Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsLatestSetValue
  Description: This test checks if the getId() method returns the most recently set ID value after multiple setId() calls.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object and set its ID multiple times with different values.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Book object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID matches the last value that was set.

Validation:
  This test confirms that the getId() method always returns the most up-to-date ID value, which is crucial for maintaining data consistency, especially in scenarios where the ID might be updated during the object's lifecycle.
```

These scenarios cover the basic functionality of the `getId()` method, including edge cases like null values and multiple updates. They ensure that the method behaves correctly under various conditions, which is essential for maintaining data integrity and proper object identification in the application.
