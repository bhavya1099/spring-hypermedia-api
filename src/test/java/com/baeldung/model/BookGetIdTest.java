"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if method returns a Long value
  Details:
    TestName: testIfMethodReturnsLongValue.
    Description: The method getId() is supposed to return a Long type of value. This test is to check if the method returns a Long type of value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We don't need to arrange any data as there is no input to the method.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is an instance of Long class.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify the return type of the getId() method. Since the method documentation states that the return type should be Long, this is the expected result.
    This is important as misalignment of data types can lead to data inconsistency in the application.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if returned value from getId method matches the expected value
  Details:
    TestName: testIfReturnedValueMatchesExpected.
    Description: The test is meant to check if the value returned from the method getId() matches the expected id value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object and set a known id value.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the known id value.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify that the getId method returns the accurate id value. Incorrect value may lead to retrieval of wrong data from the database.
    This is critical to the functioning of the application as data integrity and accuracy is essential in any application.

  Scenario 3: Testing if the returned value is null
  Details:
    TestName: testIfReturnedValueIsNull.
    Description: The test verifies if the getId() method returns null in case the id is not set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object without setting an id value.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The test aims to check the behavior of the getId() method when the id is not set. This is an expected behavior as not all instantiated objects have an id value at the beginning.
    This is crucial as returning null when id is not set can help in identifying newly instantiated objects in the application.
