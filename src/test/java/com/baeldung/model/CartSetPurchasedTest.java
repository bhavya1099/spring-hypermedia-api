"""
Scenario 1: Test to Check if Purchased Set to True Works
Details:
  TestName: testSetPurchasedTrue
  Description: A simple test intended to ensure that the setPurchased method works correctly when provided true as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no need for any setup as we're directly invoking the method.
  Act: Invoke the setPurchased method with true as the argument.
  Assert: Use assertions to confirm that the purchased attribute has been set to true.
Validation:
  Verify that setting purchased to true indeed sets the attribute to true. This ensures that the system correctly recognizes a purchased item.

Scenario 2: Test to Check if Purchased Set to False Works
Details:
  TestName: testSetPurchasedFalse
  Description: A similar test as above, but in this case, it checks if the setPurchased method works correctly when provided false as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no need for any setup as we're directly invoking the method.
  Act: Invoke the setPurchased method with false as the argument.
  Assert: Use assertions to confirm that the purchased attribute has been set to false.
Validation:
  Verify that setting purchased to false indeed sets the attribute to false. This ensures that the system correctly recognises when an item is not purchased.

Scenario 3: Update SetPurchased From True to False Test
Details:
  TestName: testUpdatePurchasedTrueToFalse
  Description: A test to check that setPurchased updates the attribute correctly when changing from true to false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the purchased attribute directly to true.
  Act: Invoke the setPurchased method with false as the argument.
  Assert: Use assertions to confirm that the purchased attribute has been updated to false.
Validation:
  Verify that calling setPurchased with a different value updates the attribute correctly. This checks that the status of an item can be updated in the system.

Scenario 4: Test for Setting Purchased Back and Forth
Details:
  TestName: testPurchasedSwitching
  Description: This test is for checking that the purchased attribute can be switched back and forth several times and still reflect the correct status.
Execution:
  Arrange: You don't need any preceding arrangement as the method is called directly.
  Act: Invoke setPurchased with true as argument, then invoke it again with false, and again with true.
  Assert: Use assertions to validate that the purchased attribute is indeed true.
Validation:
  Verify that the purchased attribute can be switched back and forth without problems.
