"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check setTitle functionality when provided a valid title string.

  Details:
    TestName: setTitleWithValidTitle.
    Description: This test is meant to validate the basic functionality of the setTitle method when it's given a valid title string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a valid title string variable.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the valid title string.
    Assert: Use a getter to get the title and then assert that the title received is the same as the one set.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify the functionality of setTitle method, ensuring the title string gets properly assigned. It ensures the basic integrity of the method under normal conditions.


  Scenario 2: Test to check setTitle functionality when provided with an empty string.

  Details:
    TestName: setTitleWithEmptyString.
    Description: This test is to check the behavior of setTitle method when given an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a string variable with an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the empty string.
    Assert: Retrieve the title and assert that it's indeed empty string.
  Validation:
    This test is important as it verifies the functionality when provided with an empty string, which is a borderline scenario testing the robustness of the method.


  Scenario 3: Test setTitle method when the supplied title string is null.

  Details:
    TestName: setTitleWithNull.
    Description: This test aims to validate the behavior of setTitle method when the input parameter is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a null string variable.
    Act: Call setTitle method with the null string.
    Assert: Assert that the value returned by getTitle method is null.
  Validation:
    This test is crucial to ensure that the method can handle null inputs without causing exceptions, and in line with nullable fields in JPA where null values should be allowed.


  Scenario 4: Test when setting a title that exceeds the character limit imposed by the database.

  Details:
    TestName: setTitleExceedingDbCharacterLimit.
    Description: This test is meant to check the setTitle method behavior when the input parameter exceeds the character limit defined by the database column.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a variable with a string exceeding database column's character limit.
    Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the character exceeding string.
    Assert: Catch the database exception, likely DataTruncation, and check its message for specific truncation details.
  Validation:
    This checks if the method can handle titles that exceed the database imposed limits correctly and ensures that proper error information is provided.
