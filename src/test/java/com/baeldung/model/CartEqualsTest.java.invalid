""" 
  Scenario 1: Testing for the same object

  Details:  
    TestName: equalsForSameObject 
    Description: In this scenario, we are testing if the equals method returns true when compared with the same object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Cart object with a set of Books and its purchase status.
    Act: Invoke the equals method with the same Cart object as parameter.
    Assert: Expect the result to be true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is to verify that an object is equal to itself. This is a base condition of object equality. The expected result, true, is based on the identity principle of Java objects where each object is unique and so equals to itself.


  Scenario 2: Testing for a null object 

  Details:
    TestName: equalsForNullObject
    Description: In this scenario, we are testing if the equals method returns false when compared with a null object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Cart object with a set of Books and its purchase status.
    Act: Invoke the equals method with null as parameter.
    Assert: Expect the result to be false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is to verify that no object is equal to null. Hence the expected result, false, is aligned with the definition of object equality in Java.

   
  Scenario 3: Testing for an object of different type 

  Details:
    TestName: equalsForObjectOfDifferentType
    Description: This test is checking if the equals method returns false when compared with an object of different type.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Cart object and a Book object.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on Cart object with Book object as parameter.
    Assert: Expect the result to be false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that objects of different types are not considered equal in Java. Hence the expected result, false.

  
  Scenario 4: Testing for two similar objects with different purchase status

  Details:
    TestName: equalsForObjectsWithDifferentPurchaseStatus
    Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false for two Cart objects with the same set of books but different purchase statuses.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Cart objects with the same set of books but different purchased statuses.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one Cart object with the other Cart object as parameter.
    Assert: Expect the result to be false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that Cart objects possessing the same books but different purchased statuses are not equal. Hence the expected result, false.


  Scenario 5: Testing two separate similar objects

  Details:
    TestName: equalsForSimilarObjects
    Description: The testcase checks if the equals method returns true with two separate but identical Cart objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Cart objects with identical set of Books and identical purchase status.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one Cart object with other Cart object as parameter.
    Assert: Expect the result to be true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is to verify that two separate but identical objects are equal. Hence the expected result, true, based on the definition of equals method provided.
