### Scenario 1: Add a Non-Null Book to an Empty Cart

Details:
TestName: addNonNullBookToEmptyCart
Description: This test checks if a non-null `Book` object can be successfully added to a `Cart` that initially has no books.

Execution:
- Arrange: Create an instance of `Cart` and a non-null `Book` object.
- Act: Add the `Book` object to the `Cart` using the `add` method.
- Assert: Assert that the `Cart` now contains exactly one `Book`, and it's the one added.

Validation:
- The assertion confirms that the `Book` is successfully added to the `Cart`. The correct functionality of the `add` method ensures that the `books` list transitions from null or empty to containing one `Book`.
- This test is significant because it validates that items can be added to an empty cart, which is a common case in a shopping flow.

### Scenario 2: Add a Null Book to Cart

Details:
TestName: addNullBookToCart
Description: This test checks the behavior when attempting to add a null `Book` to the `Cart`.

Execution:
- Arrange: Create an instance of `Cart`.
- Act: Try to add a null `Book` object to the `Cart` using the `add` method.
- Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown (like `NullPointerException`).

Validation:
- The assertion ensures the robustness of the `add` method by checking exception handling when a null object is passed.
- This test is crucial for confirming that error handling mechanisms are in place for invalid input, which is a fundamental aspect of stable software behavior.

### Scenario 3: Add Book to Cart with Existing Books

Details:
TestName: addBookToCartWithExistingBooks
Description: This test checks if a `Book` can be added to a `Cart` that already contains some books.

Execution:
- Arrange: Create an instance of `Cart`, add some `Book` objects initially.
- Act: Add another distinct `Book` object to the `Cart`.
- Assert: Assert that the `Cart` now contains the new `Book` in addition to the previously added books.

Validation:
- The assertion verifies that the `add` method handles additions correctly when the cart already has other items, preserving existing data while adding new entries.
- The significance of this test lies in verifying that new products can be added to an ongoing shopping session without disrupting existing selections.

---

### Scenario 4: Ensure Added Book is Exact in Cart

Details:
TestName: ensureAddedBookIsExactInCart
Description: Validate that the `Book` added to the cart is the exact object by reference, not just by similar attributes.

Execution:
- Arrange: Create a `Cart` and a `Book` instance.
- Act: Add the `Book` to the `Cart`.
- Assert: Verify that the reference in the cart matches exactly the `Book` object added.

Validation:
- This verification ensures that the exact object added is stored in the cart, which can be critical for systems relying on object identity (such as when using session-based tracking).
- The importance of this test lies in ensuring data integrity and consistency, which is vital for functionalities like updating or removing items from the cart based on object identity.
