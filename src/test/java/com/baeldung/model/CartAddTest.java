Scenario 1: Add a New Book to the Book List.

  Details:
    TestName: testAddBook.
    Description: This test is meant to check if a new book can be added as expected to the existing book list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a book list and a new book to add.
    Act: Invoke the add method with the new book as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the new book has been added to the book list.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify the functionality of the 'add' method of adding a new book to the book list. The expected result is that the new book will be added to the end of the book list. This is significant to ensure that the book addition functionality works as expected.

Scenario 2: Add a null book to the Book List

  Details:
    TestName: testAddNullBook.
    Description: This test is meant to check if a NullPointerException is thrown when trying to add a null book to the list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a book list and a null book.
    Act: Invoke the add method with the null book as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if a NullPointerException is thrown.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the 'add' method throws a NullPointerException when a null book is input. This is significant to ensure that the method properly handles the error when input is null.

Scenario 3: Add a duplicate book to the Book list

  Details:
    TestName: testAddDuplicateBook.
    Description: This test is meant to check if a duplicate book can be added to the existing book list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a book list and add a book to it. Then, try to add the same book again.
    Act: Invoke the add method twice with the same book as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the duplicate book has been added to the book list.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify the functionality of the 'add' method of handling duplicate books. The expected result is that the duplicate book will be added to the book list, as ArrayList allows duplicates. This test is significant to ensure that the method behaves as expected when duplicates are present.

Scenario 4: Add a book to an empty Book list

  Details:
    TestName: testAddBookToEmptyList.
    Description: This test is meant to check if a book can be added to an empty book list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an empty book list, and a new book to add.
    Act: Invoke the add method with the new book as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the new book has been added to the book list.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify the functionality of the 'add' method of adding a new book to an empty book list. The expected result is that the new book will become the first book in the list. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle empty list scenarios appropriately.
