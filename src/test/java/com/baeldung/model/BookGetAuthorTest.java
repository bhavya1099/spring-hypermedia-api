Scenario 1: Test for Default Value of Author

Details:
  TestName: testGetAuthorDefaultValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the default value of the author is null or not. This is necessary to ensure that uninitialized string values do not negatively affect the system.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as getter function doesn't need any external data.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned author value is null as default.
Validation:
  The assertion is checking that the initial value of author is null. This ensures that the getAuthor method isn't indirectly relying on specific initialization logic.

Scenario 2: Test for Valid Author

Details:
  TestName: testGetAuthorValidValue
  Description: This test is to check whether the getAuthor method returns the expected valid author name or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign a valid author name to the author object.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned author value is equal to the set author name.
Validation:
  This assertion is checking if the getAuthor method correctly retrieves the assigned author name. It validates that the operation of retrieving a value works as expected without causing any side effects.

Scenario 3: Test for Non-ASCII Author

Details:
  TestName: testGetAuthorNonASCIIValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAuthor method can return non-ASCII author names.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign a non-ASCII character string to the author variable.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the initial non-ASCII author name.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getAuthor method correctly handles and returns non-ASCII character strings. This is important for internationalization support of the system.

Scenario 4: Test for Long Author Name Value

Details:
  TestName: testGetAuthorLongValue
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the getAuthor() method can handle very long strings
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign a very long string (beyond the typical author name length) to the author object.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned author value is equal to the set long author name.
Validation:
  The assertion is to check if the getAuthor method can handle extremely long strings, ensuring the application's robustness in handling atypical scenarios.
