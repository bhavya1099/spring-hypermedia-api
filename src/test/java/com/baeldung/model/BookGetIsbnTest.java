Scenario 1: Check ISBN Return

Details:
TestName: checkGetIsbnReturnValue
Description: This test checks whether the method getIsbn accurately fetches the ISBN stored in the object.

Execution:
Arrange: An object with a known ISBN is created.
Act: getIsbn method is called.
Assert: The value returned by getIsbn is compared with the known ISBN.

Validation:
This test verifies that the getIsbn method successfully retrieves the ISBN stored in the object. This is significant because it pertains to fundamental get functionality and thus impacts the robustness and reliability of data retrieval.

Scenario 2: Check Empty ISBN Return

Details:
TestName: checkEmptyIsbnReturnValue
Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of the getIsbn method when the ISBN in the object is an empty string.

Execution:
Arrange: An object is created with an empty ISBN.
Act: Call the getIsbn method.
Assert: Validate that the return value is an empty string.

Validation:
This test checks that the getIsbn method handles empty ISBNs correctly. It is important because it ensures that the method can handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Check Null ISBN Return

Details:
TestName: checkNullIsbnReturnValue
Description: This test is designed to see how the getIsbn method deals with null ISBNs.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an object with a null ISBN.
Act: Invoke the getIsbn method.
Assert: Confirm that the return value is null.

Validation:
This test verifies that the getIsbn method will handle null ISBNs gracefully. This is critical as it impacts the robustness of the method and prevents potential NullPointerExceptions.

Scenario 4: Check Non-String ISBN Return

Details:
TestName: checkNonStringIsbnReturnValue
Description: This test is meant to see if the getIsbn method can handle non-string ISBNs.

Execution:
Arrange: An object with a non-string ISBN (number or object) is created.
Act: Invoke the getIsbn method.
Assert: Confirm that a ClassCastException is thrown.

Validation:
This assertion checks if the getIsbn method can handle non-string ISBNs appropriately. If it fails to do so, then the method might return incorrect data or cause unexpected errors.

//If you have issues running this test, make sure your setup meets following criteria:
//- The book.setIsbn/is used and implemented in the Book class. If the method is not implemented, defined or even if there are typo errors in method's name, it can lead to compilation error
//- Make sure you have the right version of JUnit installed and included in your classpath (it should be JUnit 5 for this case)
