"""
Scenario 1: Validate normal behavior of getBooks method

Details:
  TestName: testGetBooksNormalBehavior
  Description: An assertion to ensure the 'getBooks' method works as expected in a regular scenario where the books are expected to exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create and populate an 'books' list with Book objects.
  Act: Invoke 'getBooks' method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list matches the 'books' list that was created.
Validation:
  We aim to validate that the returned list contains the correct books from the 'books' list. This is significant in ensuring that the 'getBooks' method accurately fetches the list of Book objects.

Scenario 2: Validate getBooks method when no books exist

Details:
  TestName: testGetBooksWhenNoBooksExist
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the 'getBooks' method when there are no books available.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty 'books' list.
  Act: Invoke 'getBooks' method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The purpose of this test is to verify that the 'getBooks' method can correctly handle situations where there are no books available. The result is expected to be an empty list. This is significant in ensuring the 'getBooks' method's stability and error handling.

Scenario 3: Validate getBooks method with a large number of books

Details:
  TestName: testGetBooksLargeNumberOfBooks
  Description: This test validates the 'getBooks' method's performance and behavior under load, specifically, when a large number of books exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 'books' list with a large number of Book objects.
  Act: Invoke 'getBooks' method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list's size matches the size of the 'books' list.
Validation:
  The intent of this test is to validate the 'getBooks' method's ability to handle large data sets. This is critical in stress-testing the method's performance and ensuring it can reliably handle large data sets.
