Scenario 1: Test to check the getTitle method when the title of the book is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetTitleWhenTitleIsSet
  Description: This test is designed to verify the functionality of the getTitle method when the title of the book is set. It aims to check if the method returns the correct title as set using the setTitle method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Book object and set the title using the setTitle method.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the Book object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual title returned by the getTitle method against the expected title.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getTitle method is correctly returning the title of the book. This is important as the title of the book is a crucial attribute and any errors in its retrieval can cause serious issues in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check the getTitle method when the title of the book is not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetTitleWhenTitleIsNotSet
  Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of the getTitle method when the title of the book is not set. It aims to check if the method returns null as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Book object without setting the title.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the Book object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual title returned by the getTitle method against the expected value (null in this case).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getTitle method is correctly returning null when the title of the book is not set. This is important as it ensures that the method behaves correctly when dealing with uninitialized attributes.

Scenario 3: Test to check the getTitle method when the title of the book is an empty string

Details:
  TestName: testGetTitleWhenTitleIsEmpty
  Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of the getTitle method when the title of the book is set as an empty string. It aims to check if the method returns an empty string as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Book object and set the title as an empty string using the setTitle method.
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the Book object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual title returned by the getTitle method against the expected value (empty string in this case).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getTitle method is correctly returning an empty string when the title of the book is set as such. This is important as it ensures that the method behaves correctly in edge cases.
