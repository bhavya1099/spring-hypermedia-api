Scenario 1: Validate getTitle method when the title is set
Details:
  TestName: validateGetTitleWhenTitleIsSet
  Description: The test is intended to verify the getTitle method when the book title is already set. This will test the normal functionality of the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class and set a title using the setTitle method.
  Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title returned by the getTitle method matches the title set.
Validation:
  This assertion looks to confirm that the getTitle method correctly retrieves the title when it is set. If the test passes, it shows that the getTitle method is functioning as expected when the book title is set.

Scenario 2: Validate getTitle method when title is not set
Details:
  TestName: validateGetTitleWhenTitleIsNotSet
  Description: The test aims to check the getTitle method when the book title is not set. This will test the getTitle method's behavior in scenarios where the title has not yet been defined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class without setting the title.
  Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title returned by the getTitle method is null.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getTitle method should return null when the title has not been set. This shows that getTitle can handle a situation where the book's title has not yet been defined.

Scenario 3: Validate getTitle method with different cases of title string
Details:
  TestName: validateGetTitleWithDifferentCases
  Description: The test is intended to confirm the getTitle method's behavior when the book title is set with different cases (upper case, lower case, mixed case).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class and set the title with different cases using the setTitle method.
  Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title returned by the getTitle method matches the title set, including case sensitivity.
Validation:
  The test validates that the getTitle method should return the exact title string, maintaining case sensitivity. This shows that the getTitle method does not alter the string case when retrieving the title.

Scenario 4: Validate behavior of getTitle method when title is set to empty string
Details:
  TestName: validateGetTitleForEmptyTitle
  Description: The test is aimed to verify the getTitle method when the book title is set to an empty string. This will test the behavior of the getTitle with edge case scenarios.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class and set the title as an empty string using the setTitle method.
  Act: Invoke the getTitle method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the getTitle method returns an empty string.
Validation:
  This test aims to validate that the getTitle method returns an empty string when the book title is set as such. It evidences that getTitle method can handle situations where the title is empty.
