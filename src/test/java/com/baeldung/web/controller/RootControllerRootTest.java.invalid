  Scenario 1: Test the RootController root method returns a RootResource instance 

  Details:  
    TestName: testRootMethodReturnsRootResourceInstance
    Description: This test is meant to check if the root method in the RootController class is returning an instance of the RootResource class. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the RootController class.
    Act: Invoke the root method of the RootController instance. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is an instance of the RootResource class.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the returned object from the root method is an instance of the RootResource class, as expected by the method declaration. This test is significant in ensuring that the root method is functioning as expected and returning the correct type of object.

  Scenario 2: Test the RootController root method returns a non-null object 

  Details:  
    TestName: testRootMethodReturnsNonNull
    Description: This test is meant to check if the root method in the RootController class is returning a non-null object. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the RootController class.
    Act: Invoke the root method of the RootController instance. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is not null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the returned object from the root method is not null. It is expected that the method should always return a new instance of RootResource and never a null object. This test is important to ensure that the method is not returning null, which could potentially lead to NullPointerExceptions in other parts of the application where this method is called.

  Scenario 3: Test the RootController root method returns a new instance on each call 

  Details:  
    TestName: testRootMethodReturnsNewInstance
    Description: This test is meant to check if the root method in the RootController class is returning a new instance of RootResource on each call. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the RootController class.
    Act: Invoke the root method of the RootController instance twice. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the two returned objects are not the same.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the returned objects from the root method are not the same, indicating that a new instance is created on each call. This is expected as the method should create and return a new instance of RootResource every time it is called. This test is significant in ensuring that the method is not returning the same instance on each call, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the instances are modified elsewhere in the application.
