Scenario 1: Normal Scenario where the book object is returned
Details:  
    TestName: getBookNormalScenario
    Description: This test checks the normal behavior of the getBook method. It is expected to return the book object which was previously set. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a BookResource object and set a book object.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method on the BookResource object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned book object is the same as the one that was set.
Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getBook method returns the expected book object. This is important as it confirms the correct functionality of the getBook method.

Scenario 2: Scenario where the book object is not set
Details:  
    TestName: getBookWithoutSetting
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the getBook method when the book object has not been set. It is expected to return null in this case. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a BookResource object without setting a book object.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method on the BookResource object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned book object is null.
Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getBook method returns null when the book object has not been set. This is important as it confirms the correct functionality of the getBook method when no book object is set.

Scenario 3: Scenario where the book object is changed after it is set
Details:  
    TestName: getBookAfterChange
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the getBook method after the book object has been changed. It is expected to return the latest book object. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a BookResource object and set a book object. Change the book object after setting it.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method on the BookResource object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned book object is the same as the latest one.
Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getBook method returns the latest book object even after it has been changed. This is important as it confirms the correct functionality of the getBook method after the book object has been changed.
