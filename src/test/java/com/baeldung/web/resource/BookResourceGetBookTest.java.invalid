Scenario 1: Test to check if getBook method returns a book object

Details:  
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsBookObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns a book object as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as there is no input for this method.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is an instance of the Book class.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns a book object. This is the expected result because the getBook method should return an instance of the Book class. The test is significant in ensuring that the getBook method behaves as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getBook method returns null when the book object has not been set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsNullWhenBookNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns null when the book object has not been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as there is no input for this method.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns null when the book object has not been set. This is the expected result because the book object is initialized as null and there is no method to set the book object. The test is significant in ensuring that the getBook method behaves as expected when the book object has not been set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getBook method returns the same book object every time it is called

Details:  
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsSameObjectOnMultipleCalls
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns the same book object every time it is called.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as there is no input for this method.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method multiple times.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is the same for all the calls.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns the same book object every time it is called. This is the expected result because the book object is final and cannot be changed once initialized. The test is significant in ensuring that the getBook method behaves as expected when called multiple times.
