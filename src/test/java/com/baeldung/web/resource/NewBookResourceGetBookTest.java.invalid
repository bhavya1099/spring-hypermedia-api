"""
  Scenario 1: Test that the getBook method returns a book correctly

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetBookReturnsCorrectBook.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the getBook method returns the correct book. The target scenario is when the getBook method is invoked normally. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a NewBookResource object and set the book field. 
    Act: Invoke the getBook method on the NewBookResource object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned book against the book set in the arrange step.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns the correct book. The expected result is the book set in the arrange step. The significance of this test is to ensure that the getBook method functions correctly, which is crucial for retrieving the correct book data.

  Scenario 2: Test that the getBook method handles null book correctly

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetBookHandlesNullBook.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the getBook method can handle a null book. The target scenario is when the book field is null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a NewBookResource object without setting the book field. 
    Act: Invoke the getBook method on the NewBookResource object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the returned book is null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getBook method can handle a null book. The expected result is null. The significance of this test is to ensure that the getBook method can handle edge cases, which is crucial for avoiding unexpected errors in the application.

  Scenario 3: Test that the getBook method returns a book with the correct properties

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetBookReturnsBookWithCorrectProperties.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the getBook method returns a book with the correct properties. The target scenario is when the book field is set with a book with specific properties. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a NewBookResource object and set the book field with a book with specific properties. 
    Act: Invoke the getBook method on the NewBookResource object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the properties of the returned book against the properties of the book set in the arrange step.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns a book with the correct properties. The expected result is the book with the specific properties set in the arrange step. The significance of this test is to ensure that the getBook method returns a book with the correct properties, which is crucial for retrieving accurate book data.
