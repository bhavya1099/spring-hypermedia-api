"""
Scenario 1: Verify the getBook method returns a null object when the book is not initialized

Details:
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsNullWhenNotInitialized
  Description: This test is meant to check the getBook method when the book object is not initialized. The test should return null since no book object has been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary in this scenario as the book is not initialized.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned book object is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method handles the case when the book object is not initialized. The expected result is null because the book object has not been set. This test is significant to ensure the getBook method correctly handles null cases.

Scenario 2: Verify the getBook method returns the correct book object when it's initialized

Details:
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsCorrectObjectWhenInitialized
  Description: This test is meant to check the getBook method when the book object is initialized. The test should return the book object that was set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the book object.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned book object is the same as the one that was set.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns the correct book object when it's initialized. The expected result is the same book object that was set. This test is significant to ensure the getBook method correctly returns the book object when it's initialized.

Scenario 3: Verify the getBook method returns a new copy of the book object

Details:
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsNewCopyOfBook
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns a new copy of the book object. The test should return a different object but with the same values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the book object.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned book object is not the same as the one that was set but has the same values.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns a new copy of the book object. The expected result is a different object but with the same values. This test is significant to ensure the getBook method correctly returns a new copy of the book object.
