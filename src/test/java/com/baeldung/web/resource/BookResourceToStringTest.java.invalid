"Scenario 1: Testing the toString method when the book object is null

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithNullBook.
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString method when the book object is null. The target scenario is when the book is not yet initialized or set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a BookResource object without setting the book.
  Act: Invoke the toString method of the BookResource object. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned string contains "book=null". 
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the toString method correctly handles null book objects. The expected result is based on the implementation of the toString method, which should print "book=null" when the book object is null. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the toString method against null inputs.

Scenario 2: Testing the toString method when the book object is not null

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithNonNullBook.
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString method when the book object is not null. The target scenario is when the book is properly initialized or set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object and set its properties. Create a BookResource object and set the book.
  Act: Invoke the toString method of the BookResource object. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned string contains the properties of the book. 
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the toString method correctly prints the properties of the book. The expected result is based on the implementation of the toString method, which should print the properties of the book when the book object is not null. This test is significant as it checks the correct functioning of the toString method when the book object is properly initialized.

Scenario 3: Testing the toString method when the book object is changed

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWhenBookChanges.
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString method when the book object is changed after being set in the BookResource. The target scenario is when the book object changes after being set in the BookResource. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object and set its properties. Create a BookResource object and set the book. Change the properties of the book.
  Act: Invoke the toString method of the BookResource object. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned string contains the updated properties of the book. 
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the toString method reflects changes in the book object. The expected result is based on the implementation of the toString method, which should print the updated properties of the book when the book object changes. This test is significant as it checks that the toString method correctly reflects changes in the state of the book object.
