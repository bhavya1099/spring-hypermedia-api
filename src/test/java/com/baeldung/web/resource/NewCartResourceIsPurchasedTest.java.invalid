  Scenario 1: Test to check if the isPurchased method returns true when a purchase is made

  Details:  
    TestName: testIsPurchasedAfterPurchase.
    Description: This test checks if the isPurchased method returns true after a purchase has been made. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a NewCartResource object. Use the setPurchased method to set purchased to true.
    Act: Invoke the isPurchased method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the isPurchased method returns true after a purchase. This is expected because the setPurchased method was used to set purchased to true. This test is significant as it verifies the correct functionality of the isPurchased method.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if the isPurchased method returns false when no purchase is made

  Details:  
    TestName: testIsPurchasedBeforePurchase.
    Description: This test checks if the isPurchased method returns false before any purchase has been made. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a NewCartResource object. Do not use the setPurchased method.
    Act: Invoke the isPurchased method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the isPurchased method returns false when no purchase has been made. This is expected because the setPurchased method was not used to set purchased to any value. This test is significant as it verifies the correct functionality of the isPurchased method.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if the isPurchased method returns false after a purchase has been cancelled

  Details:  
    TestName: testIsPurchasedAfterPurchaseCancellation.
    Description: This test checks if the isPurchased method returns false after a purchase has been cancelled. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a NewCartResource object. Use the setPurchased method to set purchased to true, then use it again to set purchased to false.
    Act: Invoke the isPurchased method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the isPurchased method returns false after a purchase has been cancelled. This is expected because the setPurchased method was used to set purchased to false. This test is significant as it verifies the correct functionality of the isPurchased method.
