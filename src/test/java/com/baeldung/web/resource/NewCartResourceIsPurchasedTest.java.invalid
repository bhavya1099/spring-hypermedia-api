Scenario 1: Test to Check if the Cart is Purchased

Details:  
  TestName: isCartPurchased.
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the "isPurchased" method returns true when the cart is marked as purchased.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of NewCartResource and set purchased to true using setPurchased method.
    Act: Invoke the isPurchased method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is true.
  Validation: 
    The aim of this assertion is to verify if the isPurchased method accurately reflects the purchased status of the cart. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the isPurchased method.

Scenario 2: Test to Check if the Cart is Not Purchased

Details:  
  TestName: isCartNotPurchased.
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the "isPurchased" method returns false when the cart is not marked as purchased.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of NewCartResource and set purchased to false using setPurchased method.
    Act: Invoke the isPurchased method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is false.
  Validation: 
    The aim of this assertion is to verify if the isPurchased method accurately reflects the purchased status of the cart. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the isPurchased method.

Scenario 3: Test to Check the Default Value of isPurchased

Details:  
  TestName: checkDefaultValueOfIsPurchased.
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the "isPurchased" method returns false by default when the cart is newly created and the purchased status is not set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of NewCartResource without setting the purchased status.
    Act: Invoke the isPurchased method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is false.
  Validation: 
    The aim of this assertion is to verify if the isPurchased method accurately reflects the default purchased status of the cart. This test is significant as it verifies the default behavior of the isPurchased method when the purchased status is not explicitly set.
