"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getBook method returns a book object
Details:
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsBookObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns a book object as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as there is no input for this method.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is an instance of the Book class.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns a book object.
    This is crucial in ensuring that the method is functioning as expected and is able to retrieve the book object.
Scenario 2: Test to check if getBook method returns null when no book is set
Details:
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsNullWhenNoBookIsSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns null when no book is set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as there is no input for this method.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns null when no book is set.
    This is crucial in ensuring that the method handles the scenario where no book is set appropriately.
Scenario 3: Test to check if getBook method returns the correct book when a book is set
Details:
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsCorrectBookWhenBookIsSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns the correct book when a book is set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the book object in the BookResource class.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned book is the same as the one set.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns the correct book when a book is set.
    This is crucial in ensuring that the method is functioning as expected and is able to retrieve the correct book object.

/*
The errors you're seeing are not related to the test itself but to the inability to compile the code due to missing dependencies. The error logs indicate that the package 'org.springframework.hateoas.mvc' does not exist. This package is part of the Spring HATEOAS library, which provides APIs to simplify creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle. 

The issue here is that the classes in your project are trying to import this package, but it's not present in your project's classpath. This could be due to a missing or incorrect version of the Spring HATEOAS dependency in your project's build configuration file (like pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle). 

As a result, the test `testGetBookReturnsBookObject()` is not even running because the test suite fails to compile due to these errors. To resolve this, you need to add the correct version of the Spring HATEOAS library to your project dependencies.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testGetBookReturnsBookObject() {
    Book book = new Book();
    BookResource bookResource = new BookResource(book);
    assertEquals(book, bookResource.getBook(), "Expected book object to be returned");
}
*/
/*
The test failure is not directly related to the business logic or the test case itself. Instead, the errors are due to missing dependencies. The test case is failing because of the lack of necessary Spring HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) dependencies, specifically the 'org.springframework.hateoas.mvc' package. This package does not exist or is not found in the classpath.

This package is required for representing RESTful resources and links and is a critical part of the Spring HATEOAS library. The errors indicate that multiple classes across the application are trying to import this package and failing, which implies that the package is not available in the build path of the project.

To resolve this issue, the correct version of the Spring HATEOAS dependency should be added to the project's build file (like pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle). After adding the dependency, a clean build of the project should be done to ensure that the required packages are downloaded and added to the classpath.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testGetBookReturnsNullWhenNoBookIsSet() {
    BookResource bookResource = new BookResource(null);
    assertNull(bookResource.getBook(), "Expected null to be returned when no book is set");
}
*/
/*
The unit test failure is not directly related to the test function itself but rather due to missing external dependencies. The error logs clearly indicate that the package `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` does not exist. This package is part of the Spring HATEOAS project which provides APIs to simplify creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle.

The missing package is causing compilation errors in several classes, including `BookController`, `BookResource`, `RootResource`, `CartResource`, `NewBookResource`, `NewCartController`, `NewCartResource`, and `NewBookController`. 

To rectify this issue, the `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` package needs to be added as a dependency in the project's build configuration (like Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle file). Once this package is properly included and the project is rebuilt, the compilation errors should be resolved, and the unit test should be able to run successfully.

Please note that it's also possible that the package has been deprecated or moved in a recent version of Spring HATEOAS. If that's the case, you might need to update your code to use the new classes or interfaces.

    Book book = new Book();
    BookResource bookResource = new BookResource(book);
