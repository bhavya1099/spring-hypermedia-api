"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getBook method returns a book object
Details:
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsBookObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns a book object as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as there is no input for this method.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is an instance of the Book class.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns a book object.
    This is crucial in ensuring that the method is functioning as expected and is able to retrieve the book object.
Scenario 2: Test to check if getBook method returns null when no book is set
Details:
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsNullWhenNoBookIsSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns null when no book is set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as there is no input for this method.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns null when no book is set.
    This is crucial in ensuring that the method handles the scenario where no book is set appropriately.
Scenario 3: Test to check if getBook method returns the correct book when a book is set
Details:
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsCorrectBookWhenBookIsSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns the correct book when a book is set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the book object in the BookResource class.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned book is the same as the one set.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns the correct book when a book is set.
    This is crucial in ensuring that the method is functioning as expected and is able to retrieve the correct book object.

The test failure is not due to the test itself or the business logic of the method being tested. The test failure is due to a missing external dependency in the project. 

The error logs indicate that the package `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` does not exist. This package is part of the Spring HATEOAS library, which provides some APIs to ease creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle. The class `ResourceSupport` which is extended by the class containing the method being tested, is part of this library.

This means the Spring HATEOAS library is not available in the classpath during the build and test phases. This could have happened if the dependency was not correctly specified in the project's build configuration (pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle), or if there was an issue with the build tool not being able to download the dependency from the specified repositories.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the Spring HATEOAS library is properly specified as a dependency in the build configuration and that the build tool can access the necessary repositories to download the library.

/*
The error logs indicate that the test is failing due to a missing package: `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc`. This package does not exist or is not found in the classpath. This package seems to be a part of the Spring HATEOAS project which provides APIs to simplify creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle. 

The classes in your project are trying to import this package, but the JVM cannot find it. This is likely because the package is not included in the project's dependencies. This could be due to several reasons such as the package not being included in the build configuration file (like pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle), or the package not being correctly installed in the local repository.

In order to run this test successfully, the missing package `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` needs to be correctly included in the project's dependencies. Check the project's build configuration and ensure that the Spring HATEOAS dependency is correctly specified and installed. If the project uses a build tool like Maven or Gradle, the dependency can be added in the respective configuration file (pom.xml or build.gradle). Once the dependency is included correctly, the build process should be able to find and load the required classes from this package.

The errors provided indicate that the package `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` does not exist. This package seems to be a part of Spring HATEOAS, a library for creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle. 

The issue here is not with the test case itself, but with the project setup. The package `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` might be missing from the classpath due to one or more of the following reasons:

1. The Spring HATEOAS dependency is not added in the build configuration file (like pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle).
2. The version of Spring HATEOAS included does not contain the `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` package. This could happen if an outdated or incompatible version of the library is being used.
3. There might be an issue with the project setup or IDE configuration causing the libraries not to be recognized correctly.

To fix these errors, ensure that the Spring HATEOAS library is correctly added as a dependency in the project's build configuration file and the project setup or IDE configuration is correct.
