"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getBook method returns a book object
Details:
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsBookObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns a book object as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as there is no input for this method.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is an instance of the Book class.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns a book object. This is the expected result because the getBook method should return an instance of the Book class. The test is significant in ensuring that the getBook method behaves as expected.
Scenario 2: Test to check if getBook method returns null when the book object has not been set
Details:
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsNullWhenBookNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns null when the book object has not been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as there is no input for this method.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns null when the book object has not been set. This is the expected result because the book object is initialized as null and there is no method to set the book object. The test is significant in ensuring that the getBook method behaves as expected when the book object has not been set.
Scenario 3: Test to check if getBook method returns the same book object every time it is called
Details:
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsSameObjectOnMultipleCalls
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns the same book object every time it is called.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as there is no input for this method.
    Act: Invoke the getBook method multiple times.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is the same for all the calls.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns the same book object every time it is called. This is the expected result because the book object is final and cannot be changed once initialized. The test is significant in ensuring that the getBook method behaves as expected when called multiple times.

/*
The test is failing not because of an issue with the test itself, but due to missing dependencies in the project. The error messages are stating that the package "org.springframework.hateoas.mvc" does not exist. This package is part of the Spring HATEOAS library, which provides APIs to simplify creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle. 

The classes in your project are trying to import this package, but it seems like the library is not available, hence the import statements are failing, leading to a compilation error. 

To fix the issue, you need to ensure that the Spring HATEOAS library is properly included as a dependency in your project's build configuration (such as in Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle file). This library is a prerequisite to run the test and the application.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testGetBookReturnsBookObject() {
    Book result = bookResource.getBook();
    assertEquals(book, result, "getBook must return the book object");
}

/*
The errors listed are not directly related to the test method itself, but rather they are compilation errors that prevent the test from running. The errors indicate that the package 'org.springframework.hateoas.mvc' does not exist. This package is part of the Spring HATEOAS library, which provides APIs to simplify creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle. 

The errors suggest that this package, and potentially the entire Spring HATEOAS library, is not present in the classpath during compilation. As a result, any class in the project that tries to import and use this missing package will cause a compilation error, preventing the tests from running.

In order to run the test, the missing library needs to be added to the project's dependencies. This can be done by including the correct version of the Spring HATEOAS library in the project's build file (e.g., pom.xml for Maven, build.gradle for Gradle), and then updating the project's dependencies.

Once the missing library is added to the classpath, the compilation errors should be resolved and the test should be able to run. If the test still fails after this, then the cause of the failure would need to be investigated separately.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testGetBookReturnsNullWhenBookNotSet() {
    bookResource = new BookResource(null);
    Book result = bookResource.getBook();
    assertNull(result, "getBook must return null when the book is not set");

The errors provided indicate that the package `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` does not exist. This package seems to be a part of Spring HATEOAS, a library for creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle. 

The issue here is not with the test method itself, but with the missing dependencies in the project. The errors suggest that the Spring HATEOAS library is not properly imported or included in the build configuration (like pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle) of the project.

Therefore, the test `testGetBookReturnsSameObjectOnMultipleCalls` is not able to run because the classes it depends on (directly or indirectly), which are part of the `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` package, are not available. 

To fix this issue, you need to include the correct version of Spring HATEOAS library in your build configuration and ensure it is correctly installed or accessible during the build process.
