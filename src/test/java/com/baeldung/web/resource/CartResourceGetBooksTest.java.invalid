Scenario 1: Validate getBooks Method When Books List is Empty

Details:  
  TestName: validateGetBooksWhenListIsEmpty.
  Description: This test is meant to check the getBooks() method when the list of books is empty. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty list of books and set this list to the CartResource instance using the setBooks method.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks() method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned list is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getBooks method correctly returns an empty list when no books have been added to the cart. This is critical to ensure that the cart's state is accurately reflected when it is empty.

Scenario 2: Validate getBooks Method When Books List is Populated

Details:  
  TestName: validateGetBooksWhenListIsPopulated.
  Description: This test is meant to check the getBooks() method when the list of books is populated. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of books with one or more entries and set this list to the CartResource instance using the setBooks method.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks() method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned list is not empty and matches the list that was set. 
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getBooks method correctly returns a populated list when books have been added to the cart. This is important to ensure that the cart's state is accurately reflected when it contains items.

Scenario 3: Validate getBooks Method After Book Purchase

Details:  
  TestName: validateGetBooksAfterPurchase.
  Description: This test is meant to check the getBooks() method after a book purchase has been made. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of books with one or more entries, set this list to the CartResource instance using the setBooks method, and set the purchased flag to true using the setPurchased method.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks() method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned list is not empty and matches the list that was set, regardless of the purchased status. 
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getBooks method continues to return the correct list of books even after a purchase has been made. This is important to ensure that the cart's state is accurately reflected throughout the shopping process.
