Scenario 1: Test toString method when book object is null
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWhenBookIsNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString method when the book object is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a BookResource object with the book field set to null.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method on the BookResource object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the returned string matches the expected string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method handles null values correctly and returns the expected string. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the toString method against null values.
Scenario 2: Test toString method when book object is not null
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWhenBookIsNotNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString method when the book object is not null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object and set its fields. Then, create a BookResource object and set the book field to the created Book object.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method on the BookResource object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the returned string matches the expected string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method returns the correct string representation when the book object is not null. This test is significant as it checks the correctness of the toString method.
Scenario 3: Test toString method when book object has empty fields
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWhenBookFieldsAreEmpty
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString method when the book object has empty fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object and leave its fields empty. Then, create a BookResource object and set the book field to the created Book object.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method on the BookResource object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the returned string matches the expected string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method handles book objects with empty fields correctly and returns the expected string. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the toString method against book objects with empty fields.

/*
The failure of the test is not due to the test itself, but due to missing dependencies in the project. From the error logs, it is clear that the Java compiler could not find the package 'org.springframework.hateoas.mvc' which is used in multiple classes in the project. This package is part of the Spring HATEOAS library, which provides some APIs to ease creating REST representations that follow the principle of HATEOAS (Hypertext as the Engine of Application State).

The error logs do not provide any information about a failure in the test case 'testToStringWhenBookIsNull'. The test could not be executed because the classes could not be compiled due to the missing Spring HATEOAS library.

In order to fix this issue, you need to ensure that the Spring HATEOAS library is properly included in the project's dependencies. If you're using a build tool like Maven or Gradle, you need to include Spring HATEOAS in your build file. If you're not using a build tool, you need to manually download the jar file and include it in your classpath.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void testToStringWhenBookIsNull() {
    BookResource bookResource = new BookResource(null);
    String result = bookResource.toString();
    assertNotNull(result);
    String expected = "BookResource [book=null, toString()=" + bookResource.toString() + "]";
    assertEquals(expected, result);
}

/*
The errors provided indicate that there's a missing package, specifically the "org.springframework.hateoas.mvc" package, which is causing the build to fail. The unit test isn't even being run because the error happens during the compilation phase, not the execution phase. 

This package is a part of the Spring HATEOAS library which is a library for creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle. The classes in your code are trying to import this package, but it looks like it's not available in your classpath. 

The solution would be to include the Spring HATEOAS library in your project dependencies. If you are using Maven or Gradle, you need to add the Spring HATEOAS dependency in your build file. If the library is already included but the error persists, then it's possible that the library version you're using doesn't contain the mentioned package. In this case, you would need to use a version of the library that does contain the package. 

Also, please note that starting with version 1.0 of Spring HATEOAS, the package structure has been changed and the "mvc" package has been removed. If you're migrating from a version prior to 1.0 to a version 1.0 or later, you'll need to change your imports and possibly some of your code. 

In summary, the test isn't even getting a chance to run because the code won't compile due to the missing Spring HATEOAS package.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testToStringWhenBookIsNotNull() {
    Book book = new Book();
    book.setIsbn("1234567890");
    book.setName("Test Book");
    BookResource bookResource = new BookResource(book);
    String result = bookResource.toString();
    assertNotNull(result);
    String expected = "BookResource [book=" + book + ", toString()=" + bookResource.toString() + "]";
    assertEquals(expected, result);
}

/*
The error logs indicate that the test is failing due to compilation errors. The package `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` is not found in the classpath. This package is part of the `spring-hateoas` library, which is used to simplify creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle.

The classes under test and other related classes are trying to import this package, but it seems to be missing from the project's dependencies. This is causing the Java compiler to throw errors as it's unable to find these dependencies, hence the test fails.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the `spring-hateoas` library is correctly added to the project's dependencies in the build file (like pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle) and the project is properly built so that all dependencies are downloaded and added to the classpath. If the project is using a specific version of `spring-hateoas` library, make sure that version contains the `mvc` package.

Once the missing package is available in the classpath, the classes will compile successfully and the unit test should be able to run.
