@Test
public void persisting() {
    Book book1 = new Book();
    book1.setAuthor("Author1");
    book1.setTitle("Title1");
    book1.setIsbn(UUID.randomUUID().toString());

"Scenario 1: Testing the toString method when the book object is null
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithNullBook.
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString method when the book object is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the BookResource with a null book object.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string contains "book=null".
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method can handle null values correctly. The expected result is "book=null" since the book object is null. This test is significant in the context of ensuring that the toString method does not throw a NullPointerException when dealing with null values.
Scenario 2: Testing the toString method with a valid book object
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithValidBook.
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString method when a valid book object is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the BookResource with a valid book object.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string contains the details of the book object.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method returns a string containing the details of the book object. This test is significant as it ensures that the toString method correctly represents the state of the BookResource object.
Scenario 3: Testing the toString method with a book object having empty fields
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithEmptyFieldsBook.
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString method when the book object has empty fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the BookResource with a book object having empty fields.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string contains the details of the book object, including the empty fields.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method can handle book objects with empty fields correctly. This test is significant as it ensures that the toString method accurately represents the state of the BookResource object, even when some fields of the book object are empty.

The provided error logs suggest that the test failure is not directly related to the test case logic itself, but rather due to missing dependencies in the project. The logs show multiple errors of the same type: "package org.springframework.hateoas.mvc does not exist". 

This indicates that the project is trying to import and use the Spring HATEOAS library, specifically the 'mvc' package, which is not found in the classpath. Thus, it seems that the necessary Spring HATEOAS library is not included in the project dependencies.

In order to run this test successfully, the Spring HATEOAS dependency needs to be added to the project. This can be done through the project's dependency management system such as Maven or Gradle. Once the dependency is properly added and the project is rebuilt, the test should be able to run without encountering these import errors.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void testToStringWithNullBook() {
    Book book = null;
    BookResource bookResource = new BookResource(book);
    String result = bookResource.toString();
    assertTrue(result.contains("book=null"), "Expected 'book=null' in the string");
}
*/
/*
The errors provided are compilation errors. They all indicate that the package `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` does not exist. This package is part of the Spring HATEOAS project, which provides APIs to simplify creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle. The missing package is likely used in the `BookResource` class and other classes in the project.

The test case `testToStringWithValidBook()` itself does not seem to have any issues, but since the classes it's testing cannot be compiled due to the missing dependency, the test fails. 

To fix these issues, you need to include the Spring HATEOAS dependency in your project. If you're using Maven, you can add the dependency to your pom.xml file. If you're using Gradle, you can add it to your build.gradle file. After adding the dependency, you should be able to import the `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` package and the classes within it. 

Please note that from Spring HATEOAS 1.0 onwards, `ResourceSupport` class has been renamed to `RepresentationModel`, and the package `org.springframework.hateoas.mvc` has been replaced with `org.springframework.hateoas.server.mvc`. So, if you're using a version of Spring HATEOAS that's 1.0 or newer, you'll need to update your import statements accordingly. 

Therefore, the failure of the test case is due to the missing Spring HATEOAS dependency in the project setup, and not due to an issue with the test case itself or the business logic it's testing.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testToStringWithValidBook() {
    Book book = new Book();
    book.setIsbn("1234567890");
    book.setTitle("Test Book");
    BookResource bookResource = new BookResource(book);
    String result = bookResource.toString();
    assertTrue(result.contains("book=Book[isbn=1234567890, title=Test Book]"), "Expected book details in the string");
}

/*
The test failure is due to a missing package in the classpath. The package org.springframework.hateoas.mvc does not exist in the classpath, which is required by the classes in the spring-hypermedia-api module. This package is part of the Spring HATEOAS project which provides some APIs to ease creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle.

The missing package is causing a compilation error leading to the test failure. To resolve this issue, the package needs to be added to the classpath. This can be done by adding the correct Spring HATEOAS dependency in the project's build file (pom.xml if it's a Maven project or build.gradle if it's a Gradle project). Once the dependency is correctly added and the project is built again, the classes should compile successfully and the test should pass if there are no other issues.

    Book book = new Book();
    BookResource bookResource = new BookResource(book);
    String result = bookResource.toString();
